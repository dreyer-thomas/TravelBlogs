# Product Brief: TravelBlogs

## Executive Summary

TravelBlogs helps solo travelers and couples organize trips into shareable, map-first stories. One creator sets up a trip, captures entries with text and media, and can invite friends either to view or contribute. Unlike generic photo dumps, TravelBlogs keeps everything structured by trip, map, and timeline, with lightweight collaboration.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement
- Travelers want a web app (not just phone-only) to organize trip reports for later recall and sharing.
- Current options feel costly, phone-only, or like generic photo albums that lose the trip narrative.
- Collaboration is clunky: one person leads but needs to selectively invite friends to view or co-contribute.

### Problem Impact
- Trips get buried in unsorted photo streams and scattered notes; hard to remember where/when moments happened.
- Sharing becomes overwhelming: either oversharing on social or sending messy links with no storyline.
- Couples/solo travelers with friends miss easy “show the trip” moments without exposing everything.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- Photo apps are album-first and don’t provide trip structure or map+timeline context.
- Many tools are mobile-only or premium; collaboration is limited or coarse (no clear roles).
- There’s little narrative scaffolding: no easy way to combine text, media, and location into a cohesive story.

### Proposed Solution
- Trip-first workspace with map+timeline: entries blend text and media, anchored to time/location.
- Roles: creator owns the trip; can invite friends to view or to contribute entries.
- Web-first with mobile capture parity: easy on laptop for organization, simple on phone for capture.
- Sharing controls: private by default; selective sharing per trip; clean “show the trip” view.

### Key Differentiators
- Trip-first structure (map + timeline) instead of generic albums.
- Clear collaboration roles (owner vs viewer vs contributor) for small groups.
- Web-first organization plus mobile capture; avoids phone-only lock-in and high cost.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Solo travelers and couples who want to organize trip memories on the web, not just phone apps.
- One creator manages the trip; may invite a companion to co-contribute entries/media.
- Goals: clean map+timeline to recall where/when, narrative-friendly sharing, and optional collaboration with a travel companion.
- Pain with current tools: costly or mobile-only services, generic photo dumps, messy collab; hard to keep a cohesive trip story.

### Secondary Users
- View-only friends/family not on the trip who check daily for new entries to follow along.
- Contributors: trusted companions on the trip who can add entries/media when invited.
- Value: feel part of the journey virtually; easy, private access without social oversharing.

### User Journey (high level)
- Discover: learns about TravelBlogs as a trip-first map+timeline journaling tool for private sharing.
- Onboard: creator sets up a trip, invites a companion (optional), configures who can view vs contribute.
- Capture/Organize: creator (and invited contributor) add entries with text/media, mapped to time/location; organize later on web.
- Share/Aha: viewers get daily updates; creator sees a cohesive, shareable map+timeline story instead of scattered photos.
- Long-term: trip remains a structured, recallable journal; reusable template for future trips.

## Success Metrics

### User Success
- Creator daily capture during active trips: creators add ≥1 entry per active trip day.
- Viewer engagement on active trips: invited viewers check the trip daily when a trip is active.
- Sharing activation: invited viewers open the shared trip link and view entries within 24h of invite.
- Collaboration: invited contributors add at least one entry/media on trips with co-authors.

### Business Objectives
- Adoption: increase number of active trips and invited viewers per trip.
- Engagement: sustain daily creator posting during active trips; sustain daily viewer checks on active trips.
- Sharing growth: drive successful invite-to-view conversions.
- Retention: creators return for new trips after inactive gaps (weeks/months) without churn.

### Key Performance Indicators
- Creator activity: % of active trip days with ≥1 entry; average entries per active trip.
- Viewer engagement: % of invited viewers who view within 24h; average daily views during active trips.
- Sharing conversion: invite-to-view open rate; viewer return rate during trip.
- Collaboration: % of trips with contributors; entries per contributor.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features
- Trip-first map+timeline workspace.
- Daily entry capture with text + media + location/time.
- Roles and sharing: creator owns the trip; invite viewers or contributors; shareable trip view on web.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Premium/paywall features.
- Advanced editing/automation/AI.
- Heavy mobile-only app work.

### MVP Success Criteria
- Creators complete active trips with daily entries.
- Invited viewers open shared trips within 24h and check updates during active trips.
- Contributors add entries/media on coauthored trips when invited.
- Map+timeline shows a cohesive trip story (no scattered photo dumps).

### Future Vision
- Offline-first with background sync.
- Richer editing and templates.
- Analytics and AI summarization.
- Mobile parity and deeper collaboration features.
