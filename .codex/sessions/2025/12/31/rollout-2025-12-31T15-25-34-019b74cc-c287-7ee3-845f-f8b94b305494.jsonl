Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to enable a viewer to contribute to a specific trip,\nso that trusted people can add or edit entries.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I enable contributor access for a viewer  \n   **Then** that viewer gains contributor permissions for this trip only\n2. **Given** I disable contributor access  \n   **When** the viewer tries to add or edit entries  \n   **Then** they are blocked and can only view the trip\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add contributor access update API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` to toggle `canContribute`\n  - [ ] Validate `canContribute` boolean with Zod; return `{ data, error }`\n  - [ ] Enforce creator + trip owner authorization\n  - [ ] Return 404 for missing invite, 400 for invalid payload\n- [ ] Allow contributors to add/edit entries (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Update entry create API to allow `canContribute === true`\n  - [ ] Update entry update API to allow `canContribute === true`\n  - [ ] Keep delete restricted to creator/owner\n- [ ] Update invite UI to manage contributor access (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Show contributor status in invited viewer list\n  - [ ] Add toggle or action to enable/disable contribution per viewer\n  - [ ] Keep styling aligned with share panel patterns\n- [ ] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests for contributor toggle + access gating\n  - [ ] API tests for contributor create/edit entries\n  - [ ] Component tests for contributor toggle UI and error states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Trip access already exists via `TripAccess` with `canContribute` in Prisma; add a toggle endpoint and surface it in UI. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Current viewer invites/list live under `/api/trips/:id/viewers` with creator-only ownership checks; extend with `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts]\n- Entry create/edit are currently owner-only; allow contributors with `canContribute === true` for the trip while keeping delete creator-only. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\n- Access helper `hasTripAccess` only checks membership; add/adjust helper for `canContribute` to avoid duplicating logic. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Invite UI is in the share panel of trip detail; add per-viewer contributor toggle with existing styling. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Follow response format `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` and App Router-only API routes. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add a contributor toggle API: `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` accepting `{ canContribute: boolean }`.\n- Only the trip owner (creator) can toggle contributor access; use the same auth/ownership checks as invite endpoints.\n- 404 for missing trip or invite, 400 for invalid payload, 401/403 for auth failures.\n- Update entry create and entry update to allow contributors with `canContribute === true` on the trip; keep delete creator-only.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO date strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n- Follow naming conventions: camelCase JSON, plural REST paths, singular table names.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts` (PATCH).\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts` and `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\n- UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Shared access helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` plus `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for contributor toggle success, unauthorized access, and missing invite.\n- API tests that contributors can create and edit entries, but cannot delete.\n- Component tests for contributor toggle UI state, error display, and optimistic updates.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.4 added `TripAccess` with `canContribute` default false plus invite list/remove APIs and share panel UI. Reuse the same access checks and response formatting. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Eligible invitee logic and viewer list live in `trip-detail.tsx`; extend the invited list UI rather than creating a new panel. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent work added user management, viewer invites, and trip access checks; avoid regressions in Auth.js session usage and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; extend with a contributor check to minimize repeated queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only, REST endpoints plural, and API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Contributor access toggle and contributor entry permissions scoped and ready for implementation.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip access schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n- Trip viewer APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`\n- Trip viewer removal API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts`\n- Eligible viewers API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/eligible/route.ts`\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted contributor toggle API, contributor entry permissions, UI updates, and test coverage expectations.\n\n### File List\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
