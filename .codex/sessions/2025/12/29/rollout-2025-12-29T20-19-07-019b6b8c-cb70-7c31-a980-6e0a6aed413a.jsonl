Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

(Phase 2)\nFR2: Admin can assign a user role as creator or viewer. (Phase 2)\nFR3: System can authenticate users with email and password. (Phase 2)\nFR4: Creators can sign in and access their trips and entries. (Phase 2)\nFR5: Viewers can sign in and access trips they are allowed to view. (Phase 2)\nFR6: Creators can create trips. (Phase 1)\nFR7: Creators can edit trip metadata (name, dates, cover). (Phase 1)\nFR8: Creators can delete trips. (Phase 2)\nFR9: System can display a list of trips for a creator. (Phase 1)\nFR10: Creators can add a blog entry to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR11: Creators can edit a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR12: Creators can delete a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR13: Each entry can include a text body. (Phase 1)\nFR14: Each entry can include multiple media files. (Phase 1)\nFR15: System can display entries in a trip in chronological order. (Phase 1)\nFR16: Users can upload multiple media files in one entry. (Phase 1)\nFR17: System can display media-first entry pages. (Phase 1)\nFR18: System can show media in a gallery or carousel within an entry. (Phase 1)\nFR19: Creators can generate a shareable link to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR20: Anyone with the shareable link can view the trip. (Phase 1)\nFR21: Creators can invite specific users to a trip as viewers. (Phase 2)\nFR22: Creators can enable a viewer to contribute to a trip. (Phase 2)\nFR23: Viewers can view trips they are invited to. (Phase 2)\nFR24: Viewers with contribution enabled can add entries to that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR25: Viewers with contribution enabled can edit entries in that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR26: System can display a trip map view with entry locations. (Phase 3)\nFR27: System can display a timeline view tied to map locations. (Phase 3)\nFR28: System can extract coordinates from photo metadata. (Phase 3)\nFR29: Users can view a trip overview with latest entries. (Phase 1)\nFR30: Users can open an entry in a single-page view. (Phase 1)\nFR31: Users can navigate between entries in a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR32: Admin can manage user access and roles. (Phase 2)\nFR33: Admin can deactivate users. (Phase 2)\n\n### MVP Scope Adjustment\n\n- Lightweight authentication is required in MVP to protect creator trip/entry management.\n- This is a scope change from the PRD (which labels auth in Phase 2). Update the PRD when convenient.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Page load time is 5-10 seconds under typical home broadband.\nNFR2: Entry switching response time is under 1 second.\nNFR3: Trip switching response time is 2-5 seconds.\nNFR4: Media upload supports 10-15 files per entry under normal consumer bandwidth.\nNFR5: Use HTTPS for all traffic.\nNFR6: Store passwords using secure hashing when user management is introduced (Phase 2).\nNFR7: Shareable links are unguessable.\nNFR8: Support current versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.\nNFR9: Provide responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers.\nNFR10: Accessibility follows standard good practices (UX specifies WCAG AA).\nNFR11: SPA architecture with no multi-page app requirement.\nNFR12: No SEO requirement; app is private.\nNFR13: No real-time updates; viewers refresh to see new entries.\nNFR14: Optimize media loading and rendering to support fast entry switching.\nNFR15: Enforce role-based access on client and server.\nNFR16: Support small groups up to 15 viewers per trip.\nNFR17: Support low concurrency (2-3 concurrent viewers).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Starter: initialize with `npx

Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets,

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Lightweight creator sign-in (single account)\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (MVP + Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR0: Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) for trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nClean, modern sans-serif typography optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Source Sans 3` (crisp, contemporary)\n- Body: `Source Sans 3` (readable and consistent)\n- Fallbacks: `\"Segoe UI\", \"Calibri\", \"Arial\", sans-serif`\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative;

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs an admin,\nI want to create user accounts with email, name, and role,\nso that I can onboard creators and viewers with the right access.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as an admin  \n   **When** I create a user with email, name, and role (creator or viewer)  \n   **Then** the user account is created and visible in the user list\n2. **Given** I submit invalid or duplicate user data  \n   **When** I attempt to create the user  \n   **Then** I see clear validation errors  \n   **And** the user is not created\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Define user account data model (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add Prisma model for user with email, name, role, active status\n  - [x] Add validation rules for required fields and role enum\n- [x] Build admin user creation flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Admin UI form with email, name, role inputs and inline errors\n  - [x] API route to create users with `{ data, error }` response shape\n  - [x] Persist user records and surface in user list\n- [x] Add tests for user creation (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests for validation and duplicate handling\n  - [x] Component test for form validation feedback\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n- Phase 2 story: current auth is single creator via Auth.js Credentials provider and env vars; admin access must be defined (existing creator may act as admin until admin login is implemented).\n- User accounts must support roles (creator/viewer) and secure password storage per NFRs.\n- API responses must use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` for errors; JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Validation is server-side only (Zod); use async/await; dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n- Scope boundary: this story adds user records and admin creation UX only; do not implement user sign-in or role-based access for those users (Story 5.2+).\n- Admin access model for this story: treat the existing single creator account (Auth.js credentials user id `\"creator\"`) as the admin.\n- Epic 5 objective: enable Phase 2 account management (admin creates users, roles, access control) as foundation for signed-in creators/viewers.\n- Cross-story context: this story creates the User model and admin creation UI/API; Story 5.2 uses these users for sign-in, and Stories 5.3–5.8 depend on roles and active status.\n\n### Epic Summary (Context)\n- Epic 5 scope: admin creates users, assigns roles, manages access; enables viewers/contributors and account lifecycle in later stories.\n- This story is the foundation for account data; subsequent stories rely on role values and active status.\n- Epic 5 stories overview:\n  - 5.2 User sign-in (uses created users)\n  - 5.3 Admin changes user role\n  - 5.4 Invite viewers to a trip\n  - 5.5 Enable contributor access\n  - 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips\n  - 5.7 Contributor adds/edits entries\n  - 5.8 Admin deactivates user\n\n### Architecture Summary (Relevant)\n- Stack: Next.js App Router + Prisma/SQLite with REST route handlers and Zod validation.\n- Patterns: central `tests/`, feature-based components, `src/app/api` only, and `{ data, error }` responses.\n - Use existing middleware pattern for protected routes; public share routes must remain unauthenticated.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Add User model with role enum and active status; enforce unique email.\n- Store hashed passwords; choose a secure hashing library and document (bcrypt or argon2) with salted hashes.\n- Ensure admin-only access on user-creation endpoints (middleware or route-level checks).\n- Add a minimal password policy (length + non-empty) and return validation errors using the standard error format.\n- Define explicit user fields: `id`, `email`, `name`, `role`, `passwordHash`, `isActive`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.\n- Relationship notes (Phase 2 prep): do not add Trip/Entry relations yet; future stories will attach ownership/access via join tables or foreign keys.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural; route params use `:id` and query params are `camelCase`.\n- Keep Prisma model names singular and columns `camelCase`.\n- Use existing Prisma client access via `src/utils/db.ts`; do not introduce alternate DB layers.\n- Follow existing request/response patterns in `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (Zod validation + `{ data, error }` responses).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Prisma 7.2.0, SQLite, Auth.js 4.24.13, Zod 4.2.1.\n- Current package versions align with latest patch releases; Next.js 16.1.1 is available (package.json is 16.1.0).\n- Auth.js best practice: rely on `getToken`/session for admin gating and avoid storing plaintext credentials; use server-side credential validation only.\n- Password hashing best practice: use a strong, slow hash (bcrypt/argon2) with per-user salts; never log or return hash values.\n- Latest tech notes: no required upgrades for this story; avoid dependency bumps unless explicitly requested.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- UI components under `src/components/<feature>/`; avoid introducing `lib/` (use `src/utils/`).\n- Tests live under `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Suggested locations:\n  - API: `src/app/api/users/route.ts`\n  - Admin UI: `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`, `src/components/admin/user-form.tsx`, `src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Add API tests for user creation, duplicate email, validation errors.\n- Add component test for admin user creation form validation and error states.\n- Add a regression test to ensure non-admin requests to `/admin/users` or `/api/users` are blocked.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- Enforce `{ data, error }` API wrapper with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Keep routes plural, App Router only, and tests under `tests/`.\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; avoid Docker/TLS additions in MVP/Phase 2 work.\n\n### UX Requirements\n- Admin user creation form uses existing form patterns: labels above fields, inline validation, and clear error messaging.\n- Keep layout consistent with existing trips/entries admin pages; avoid adding new navigation paradigms.\n\n### Coding Standards (Reinforce)\n- Naming: `camelCase` variables/functions, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API params and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use async/await; no raw Promise chains.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.\n- Completion note recorded for dev handoff.\n\n### Dependencies & Prerequisites\n- Prisma migration required for new User model before API work.\n- Admin route protections should reuse existing Auth.js session/middleware patterns.\n\n### Regression Safeguards\n- Do not change creator sign-in behavior or public share link access.\n- Ensure new admin routes do not block existing `/trips/share/*` paths or public viewing.\n- Maintain existing API response shapes for trips/entries.\n\n### Reuse Guidance\n- Reuse auth/session helpers in `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts` and `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`.\n- Mirror request/response patterns in `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- Keep admin list queries small and paginatable if list grows; avoid loading unnecessary relations.\n- Maintain overall app performance targets (page load 5–10s, trip switch 2–5s, entry switch <1s) by keeping admin UI lightweight.\n\n### Deployment & Environment Notes\n- Use existing `.env`/`.env.example` pattern; do not add `.env.local`.\n- Use existing `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and creator credentials; do not introduce new required env vars for this story.\n\n### Integration & Data Flow\n- UI → `src/app/api/users/route.ts` → Prisma (`src/utils/db.ts`) → SQLite.\n- No external services for this story (no email, no third-party auth changes).\n\n### Definition of Done\n- User model added with required fields and Prisma migration applied.\n- Admin UI allows creating users with role and shows the new user in the list.\n- API returns `{ data, error }` and rejects invalid/duplicate users with correct error format.\n- Non-admin access to admin routes blocked and covered by tests.\n- Quality gate: new/updated tests pass (`npm test`), and lint passes (`npm run lint`).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Align new user management components under `src/components/<feature>/` and new pages in `src/app/` per App Router.\n- Keep routes plural and error responses wrapped; avoid new patterns that conflict with existing trips/entries APIs.\n- Existing repo is under `travelblogs/` with Prisma already configured; update schema in `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements for Story 5.1 and Phase 2 context: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- API/error/structure conventions, stack versions, file layout: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project-wide agent rules and API response shape: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Current auth setup (Credentials provider + JWT): `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\n- Current credential validation: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\n- Middleware protections: `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`\n- Prisma schema baseline: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Add User model + migration with role enum and active status defaults.\n- Add model-level test to verify required fields + defaults.\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n- Added User Prisma model, migration, and model test coverage.\n- Built admin users page + API with hashed password storage and list rendering.\n- Added API validation/duplicate tests, admin page access regression, and form validation test.\n- Tests: `npm test`\n- Updated admin users page to toggle the creation form from a single button.\n- Added a \"Back to trips\" link on the user management page.\n- Improved user creation validation messaging and client email validation.\n- Added unauthenticated access regression tests for admin users page and API.\n- Repo contains unrelated git changes outside this story scope (see `git status`).\n\n### File List\n\n- `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251229181957_add_user_model/migration.sql`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/users/user-model.test.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-form.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/users/create-user.test.ts`\n- `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/user-form.test.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/users-page.test.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/admin/users-dashboard.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/users-dashboard.test.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/package.json`\n- `travelblogs/package-lock.json`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- Completed user model, admin UI/API, and test coverage for Story 5.1.\n- `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/user-form.test.tsx`\n- Updated user validation messaging and unauthenticated access tests.\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\\n\\n## Story\\n\\nAs a user,\\nI want to sign in with my email and password,\\nso that I can access trips based on my role.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. **Given** I have a valid account\\n   **When** I submit the correct email and password\\n   **Then** I am signed in and taken to my trips\\n2. **Given** I submit invalid credentials\\n   **When** I attempt to sign in\\n   **Then** I see a clear error\\n   **And** I remain signed out\\n\\n## Tasks / Subtasks\\n\\n- [ ] Update credential authentication to use stored users (AC: 1, 2)\\n  - [ ] Look up user by email with Prisma and normalize input (trim/lowercase)\\n  - [ ] Verify `passwordHash` with `bcryptjs.compare`\\n  - [ ] Reject inactive users (`isActive = false`) without revealing account state\\n  - [ ] Include `id`, `email`, `role` in the JWT/session for downstream authorization\\n- [ ] Align sign-in UI copy and behavior for multi-user access (AC: 1, 2)\\n  - [ ] Update `/sign-in` messaging from “Creator Access” to user sign-in language\\n  - [ ] Keep validation + error messaging consistent with Auth.js error handling\\n  - [ ] Redirect to `/trips` or provided `callbackUrl` on success\\n- [ ] Add auth tests for sign-in (AC: 1, 2)\\n  - [ ] Unit test credential validation for valid/invalid/inactive users\\n  - [ ] Component test for sign-in form validation + error display\\n  - [ ] Regression test for sign-in redirect to callback URL on success\\n\\n## Dev Notes\\n\\n### Developer Context\\n- Epic 5 introduces accounts, roles, and authenticated access; this story is the sign-in foundation.\\n- Current auth uses Auth.js Credentials + env-based creator login (`CREATOR_EMAIL`, `CREATOR_PASSWORD`) in `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`.\\n- User accounts now exist in SQLite via Prisma `User` model with `passwordHash`, `role`, `isActive`.\\n- Admin user management (Story 5.1) hashes passwords with `bcryptjs` and treats `token.sub === \\\"creator\\\"` as admin.\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n- Replace `validateCredentials` to authenticate against the `User` table using Prisma and `bcryptjs.compare`.\\n- Preserve async/await flow and avoid raw Promise chains.\\n- Treat invalid credentials and inactive accounts with the same generic error to prevent user enumeration.\\n- Ensure JWT/session includes `id`, `email`, and `role` for downstream access checks; update `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` accordingly.\\n- Preserve compatibility for the existing creator/admin login until a DB-backed admin user is established (fallback or seed strategy).\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`.\\n- Responses from API endpoints must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for errors.\\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`; dates must be ISO 8601 strings.\\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; do not introduce `lib/`.\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite; `bcryptjs` for password hashing/verification.\\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation.\\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript; Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (no RTK Query).\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n- Auth helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`.\\n- Session typing: `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\\n- Sign-in UI: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`.\\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n- Add tests under `tests/api/auth` or `tests/utils` for credential validation logic.\\n- Add component test under `tests/components` for sign-in form validation and error handling.\\n- Include a regression test that verifies post-login redirect to `callbackUrl`.\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n- Story 5.1 created the `User` model, admin user creation flow, and uses `bcryptjs` with cost 12.\\n- Admin access currently relies on the legacy creator account (`token.sub === \\\"creator\\\"`).\\n- Do not alter user creation behavior; sign-in must be compatible with users created via `/api/users`.\\n\\n### Git Intelligence Summary\\n- Latest work added user management (Story 5.1), new admin UI/API, and Prisma `User` model.\\n- Recent changes touched shared trip views and share link routes; avoid regressions in public share paths.\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n- Verified latest versions via npm: Next.js 16.1.1, Auth.js 4.24.13, Prisma 7.2.0, Redux Toolkit 2.11.2, Zod 4.2.1.\\n- Current project versions already match; no upgrades required for this story.\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n- See `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for mandatory naming, API response shape, test location, and App Router constraints.\\n\\n### Story Completion Status\\n- Status: ready-for-dev\\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\\n\\n### References\\n- Epic requirements (Story 5.2) and Epic 5 context: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\\n- Architecture decisions, versions, and structure: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\\n- Project-wide agent rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\\n- Current auth implementation: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\\n- Sign-in page: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\\n- User model + creation API: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\\n\\n## Dev Agent Record\\n\\n### Agent Model Used\\n\\nCodex (GPT-5)\\n\\n### Debug Log References\\n\\n### Completion Notes List\\n\\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\\n\\n### File List\\n\\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\\n- `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`\\n- `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/*`\\n- `travelblogs/tests/components/*`\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_1TJJx9dYrBo8yqSdxAB60rDi"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user,\nI want to sign in with my email and password,\nso that I can access trips based on my role.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I have a valid account\n   **When** I submit the correct email and password\n   **Then** I am signed in and taken to my trips\n2. **Given** I submit invalid credentials\n   **When** I attempt to sign in\n   **Then** I see a clear error\n   **And** I remain signed out\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Update credential authentication to use stored users (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Look up user by email with Prisma and normalize input (trim/lowercase)\n  - [ ] Verify `passwordHash` with `bcryptjs.compare`\n  - [ ] Reject inactive users (`isActive = false`) without revealing account state\n  - [ ] Include `id`, `email`, `role` in the JWT/session for downstream authorization\n- [ ] Align sign-in UI copy and behavior for multi-user access (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Update `/sign-in` messaging from “Creator Access” to user sign-in language\n  - [ ] Keep validation + error messaging consistent with Auth.js error handling\n  - [ ] Redirect to `/trips` or provided `callbackUrl` on success\n- [ ] Add auth tests for sign-in (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Unit test credential validation for valid/invalid/inactive users\n  - [ ] Component test for sign-in form validation + error display\n  - [ ] Regression test for sign-in redirect to callback URL on success\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n- Epic 5 introduces accounts, roles, and authenticated access; this story is the sign-in foundation.\n- Current auth uses Auth.js Credentials + env-based creator login (`CREATOR_EMAIL`, `CREATOR_PASSWORD`) in `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`.\n- User accounts now exist in SQLite via Prisma `User` model with `passwordHash`, `role`, `isActive`.\n- Admin user management (Story 5.1) hashes passwords with `bcryptjs` and treats `token.sub === \"creator\"` as admin.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Replace `validateCredentials` to authenticate against the `User` table using Prisma and `bcryptjs.compare`.\n- Preserve async/await flow and avoid raw Promise chains.\n- Treat invalid credentials and inactive accounts with the same generic error to prevent user enumeration.\n- Ensure JWT/session includes `id`, `email`, and `role` for downstream access checks; update `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` accordingly.\n- Preserve compatibility for the existing creator/admin login until a DB-backed admin user is established (fallback or seed strategy).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- Responses from API endpoints must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for errors.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`; dates must be ISO 8601 strings.\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; do not introduce `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite; `bcryptjs` for password hashing/verification.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation.\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript; Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (no RTK Query).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Auth helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`.\n- Session typing: `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- Sign-in UI: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Add tests under `tests/api/auth` or `tests/utils` for credential validation logic.\n- Add component test under `tests/components` for sign-in form validation and error handling.\n- Include a regression test that verifies post-login redirect to `callbackUrl`.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n- Story 5.1 created the `User` model, admin user creation flow, and uses `bcryptjs` with cost 12.\n- Admin access currently relies on the legacy creator account (`token.sub === \"creator\"`).\n- Do not alter user creation behavior; sign-in must be compatible with users created via `/api/users`.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n- Latest work added user management (Story 5.1), new admin UI/API, and Prisma `User` model.\n- Recent changes touched shared trip views and share link routes;

Your mission is to **thoroughly review** a story file that was generated by the create-story workflow and **systematically identify any mistakes, omissions, or disasters** that the original LLM missed.\n\n**Your purpose is NOT just to validate - it's to FIX and PREVENT LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n### **🚨 CRITICAL MISTAKES TO PREVENT:**\n\n- **Reinventing wheels** - Creating duplicate functionality instead of reusing existing\n- **Wrong libraries** - Using incorrect frameworks, versions, or dependencies\n- **Wrong file locations** - Violating project structure and organization\n- **Breaking regressions** - Implementing changes that break existing functionality\n- **Ignoring UX** - Not following user experience design requirements\n- **Vague implementations** - Creating unclear, ambiguous implementations\n- **Lying about completion** - Implementing incorrectly or incompletely\n- **Not learning from past work** - Ignoring previous story learnings and patterns\n\n### **🚨 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:**\n\nYou must thoroughly analyze **ALL artifacts** to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important quality control function in the entire development process!\n\n### **🔬 UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS:**\n\nUse research subagents, subprocesses, or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts **simultaneously and thoroughly**. Leave no stone unturned!\n\n### **🎯 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE:**\n\nThis is a COMPETITION to create the **ULTIMATE story context** that makes LLM developer mistakes **IMPOSSIBLE**!\n\n## **🚀 HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST**\n\n### **When Running from Create-Story Workflow:**\n\n- The `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml` framework will automatically:\n  - Load this checklist file\n  - Load the newly created story file (`{story_file_path}`)\n  - Load workflow variables from `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml`\n  - Execute the validation process\n\n### **When Running in Fresh Context:**\n\n- User should provide the story file path being reviewed\n- Load the story file directly\n- Load the corresponding workflow.yaml for variable context\n- Proceed with systematic analysis\n\n### **Required Inputs:**\n\n- **Story file**: The story file to review and improve\n- **Workflow variables**: From workflow.yaml (story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, etc.)\n- **Source documents**: Epics, architecture, etc. (discovered or provided)\n- **Validation framework**: `validate-workflow.xml` (handles checklist execution)\n\n---\n\n## **🔬 SYSTEMATIC RE-ANALYSIS APPROACH**\n\nYou will systematically re-do the entire story creation process, but with a critical eye for what the original LLM might have missed:\n\n### **Step 1: Load and Understand the Target**\n\n1. **Load the workflow configuration**: `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml` for variable inclusion\n2. **Load the story file**: `{story_file_path}` (provided by user or discovered)\n3. **Load validation framework**: `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml`\n4. **Extract metadata**: epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title from story file\n5. **Resolve all workflow variables**: story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, architecture_file, etc.\n6. **Understand current status**: What story implementation guidance is currently provided?\n\n**Note:** If running in fresh context, user should provide the story file path being reviewed. If running from create-story workflow, the validation framework will automatically discover the checklist and story file.\n\n### **Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis**\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Treat this like YOU are creating the story from scratch to PREVENT DISASTERS!**\n**Discover everything the original LLM missed that could cause developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n#### **2.1 Epics and Stories Analysis**\n\n- Load `{epics_file}` (or sharded equivalents)\n- Extract **COMPLETE Epic {{epic_num}} context**:\n  - Epic objectives and business value\n  - ALL stories in this epic (for cross-story context)\n  - Our specific story's requirements, acceptance criteria\n  - Technical requirements and constraints\n  - Cross-story dependencies and prerequisites\n\n#### **2.2 Architecture Deep-Dive**\n\n- Load `{architecture_file}` (single or sharded)\n- **Systematically scan for ANYTHING relevant to this story:**\n  - Technical stack with versions (languages, frameworks, libraries)\n  - Code structure and organization patterns\n  - API design patterns and contracts\n  - Database schemas and relationships\n  - Security requirements and patterns\n  - Performance requirements and optimization strategies\n  - Testing standards and frameworks\n  - Deployment and environment patterns\n  - Integration patterns and external services\n\n#### **2.3 Previous Story Intelligence (if applicable)**\n\n- If `story_num > 1`, load the previous story file\n- Extract **actionable intelligence**:\n  - Dev notes and learnings\n  - Review feedback and corrections needed\n  - Files created/modified and their patterns\n  - Testing approaches that worked/didn't work\n  - Problems encountered and solutions found\n  - Code patterns and conventions established\n\n#### **2.4 Git History Analysis (if available)**\n\n- Analyze recent commits for patterns:\n  - Files created/modified in previous work\n  - Code patterns and conventions used\n  - Library dependencies added/changed\n  - Architecture decisions implemented\n  - Testing approaches used\n\n#### **2.5 Latest Technical Research**\n\n- Identify any libraries/frameworks mentioned\n- Research latest versions and critical information:\n  - Breaking changes or security updates\n  - Performance improvements or deprecations\n  - Best practices for current versions\n\n### **Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis**\n\n**🚨 CRITICAL: Identify every mistake the original LLM missed that could cause DISASTERS!**\n\n#### **3.1 Reinvention Prevention Gaps**\n\n- **Wheel reinvention:** Areas where developer might create duplicate functionality\n- **Code reuse opportunities** not identified that could prevent redundant work\n- **Existing solutions** not mentioned that developer should extend instead of replace\n\n#### **3.2 Technical Specification DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong libraries/frameworks:** Missing version requirements that could cause compatibility issues\n- **API contract violations:** Missing endpoint specifications that could break integrations\n- **Database schema conflicts:** Missing requirements that could corrupt data\n- **Security vulnerabilities:** Missing security requirements that could expose the system\n- **Performance disasters:** Missing requirements that could cause system failures\n\n#### **3.3 File Structure DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong file locations:** Missing organization requirements that could break build processes\n- **Coding standard violations:** Missing conventions that could create inconsistent codebase\n- **Integration pattern breaks:** Missing data flow requirements that could cause system failures\n- **Deployment failures:** Missing environment requirements that could prevent deployment\n\n#### **3.4 Regression DISASTERS**\n\n- **Breaking changes:** Missing requirements that could break existing functionality\n- **Test failures:** Missing test requirements that could allow bugs to reach production\n- **UX violations:** Missing user experience requirements that could ruin the product\n- **Learning failures:** Missing previous story context that could repeat same mistakes\n\n#### **3.5 Implementation DISASTERS**\n\n- **Vague implementations:** Missing details that could lead to incorrect or incomplete work\n- **Completion lies:** Missing acceptance criteria that could allow fake implementations\n- **Scope creep:** Missing boundaries that could cause unnecessary work\n- **Quality failures:** Missing quality requirements that could deliver broken features\n\n### **Step 4: LLM-Dev-Agent Optimization Analysis**\n\n**CRITICAL STEP: Optimize story context for LLM developer agent consumption**\n\n**Analyze current story for LLM optimization issues:**\n\n- **Verbosity problems:** Excessive detail that wastes tokens without adding value\n- **Ambiguity issues:** Vague instructions that could lead to multiple interpretations\n- **Context overload:** Too much information not directly relevant to implementation\n- **Missing critical signals:** Key requirements buried in verbose text\n- **Poor structure:** Information not organized for efficient LLM processing\n\n**Apply LLM Optimization Principles:**\n\n- **Clarity over verbosity:** Be precise and direct, eliminate fluff\n- **Actionable instructions:** Every sentence should guide implementation\n- **Scannable structure:** Use clear headings, bullet points, and emphasis\n- **Token efficiency:** Pack maximum information into minimum text\n- **Unambiguous language:** Clear requirements with no room for interpretation\n\n### **Step 5: Improvement Recommendations**\n\n**For each gap identified, provide specific, actionable improvements:**\n\n#### **5.1 Critical Misses (Must Fix)**\n\n- Missing essential technical requirements\n- Missing previous story context that could cause errors\n- Missing anti-pattern prevention that could lead to duplicate code\n- Missing security or performance requirements\n\n#### **5.2 Enhancement Opportunities (Should Add)**\n\n- Additional architectural guidance that would help developer\n- More detailed technical specifications\n- Better code reuse opportunities\n- Enhanced testing guidance\n\n#### **5.3 Optimization Suggestions (Nice to Have)**\n\n- Performance optimization hints\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n- Enhanced debugging or development tips\n\n#### **5.4 LLM Optimization Improvements**\n\n- Token-efficient phrasing of existing content\n- Clearer structure for LLM processing\n- More actionable and direct instructions\n- Reduced verbosity while maintaining completeness\n\n---\n\n## **🎯 COMPETITION SUCCESS METRICS**\n\n**You WIN against the original LLM if you identify:**\n\n### **Category 1: Critical Misses (Blockers)**\n\n- Essential technical requirements the developer needs but aren't provided\n- Previous story learnings that would prevent errors if ignored\n- Anti-pattern prevention that would prevent code duplication\n- Security or performance requirements that must be followed\n\n### **Category 2: Enhancement Opportunities**\n\n- Architecture guidance that would significantly help implementation\n- Technical specifications that would prevent wrong approaches\n- Code reuse opportunities the developer should know about\n- Testing guidance that would improve quality\n\n### **Category 3: Optimization Insights**\n\n- Performance or efficiency improvements\n- Development workflow optimizations\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n\n---\n\n## **📋 INTERACTIVE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS**\n\nAfter completing your systematic analysis, present your findings to the user interactively:\n\n### **Step 5: Present Improvement Suggestions**\n\n```\n🎯 **STORY CONTEXT QUALITY REVIEW COMPLETE**\n\n**Story:** {{story_key}} - {{story_title}}\n\nI found {{critical_count}} critical issues, {{enhancement_count}} enhancements, and {{optimization_count}} optimizations.\n\n## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)**\n\n{{list each critical issue with clear, actionable description}}\n\n## **⚡ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Should Add)**\n\n{{list each enhancement with clear benefit description}}\n\n## **✨ OPTIMIZATIONS (Nice to Have)**\n\n{{list each optimization with benefit description}}\n\n## **🤖 LLM OPTIMIZATION (Token Efficiency & Clarity)**\n\n{{list each LLM optimization that will improve dev agent performance:\n- Reduce verbosity while maintaining completeness\n- Improve structure for better LLM processing\n- Make instructions more actionable and direct\n- Enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity}}\n```\n\n### **Step 6: Interactive User Selection**\n\nAfter presenting the suggestions, ask the user:\n\n```\n**IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\nWhich improvements would you like me to apply to the story?\n\n**Select from the numbered list above, or choose:**\n- **all** - Apply all suggested improvements\n- **critical** - Apply only critical issues\n- **select** - I'll choose specific numbers\n- **none** - Keep story as-is\n- **details** - Show me more details about any suggestion\n\nYour choice:\n```\n\n### **Step 7: Apply Selected Improvements**\n\nWhen user accepts improvements:\n\n- **Load the story file**\n- **Apply accepted changes** (make them look natural, as if they were always there)\n- **DO NOT reference** the review process, original LLM, or that changes were \"added\" or \"enhanced\"\n- **Ensure clean, coherent final story** that reads as if it was created perfectly the first time\n\n### **Step 8: Confirmation**\n\nAfter applying changes:\n\n```\n✅ **STORY IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED**\n\nUpdated {{count}} sections in the story file.\n\nThe story now includes comprehensive developer guidance to prevent common implementation issues and ensure flawless execution.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the updated story\n2. Run `dev-story` for implementation\n```\n\n---\n\n## **💪 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE MINDSET**\n\n**Your goal:** Improve the story file with dev agent needed context that makes flawless implementation inevitable while being optimized for LLM developer agent consumption. Remember the dev agent will ONLY have this file to use.\n\n**Success Criteria:** The LLM developer agent that processes your improved story will have:\n\n- ✅ Clear technical requirements they must follow\n- ✅ Previous work context they can build upon\n- ✅ Anti-pattern prevention to avoid common mistakes\n- ✅ Comprehensive guidance for efficient implementation\n- ✅ **Optimized content structure** for maximum clarity and minimum token waste\n- ✅ **Actionable instructions** with no ambiguity or verbosity\n- ✅ **Efficient information density** - maximum guidance in minimum text\n\n**Every improvement should make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer to:**\n\n- Reinvent existing solutions\n- Use wrong approaches or libraries\n- Create duplicate functionality\n- Miss critical requirements\n- Make implementation errors\n\n**LLM Optimization Should Make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer agent to:**\n\n- Misinterpret requirements due to ambiguity\n- Waste tokens on verbose, non-actionable content\n- Struggle to find critical information buried in text\n- Get confused by poor structure or organization\n- Miss key implementation signals due to inefficient communication\n\n**Go create the ultimate developer implementation guide! 🚀**\n"}}

update `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` accordingly.\n    52\t- Preserve compatibility for the existing creator/admin login until a DB-backed admin user is established (fallback or seed strategy).\n    53\t\n    54\t### Architecture Compliance\n    55\t- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n    56\t- Responses from API endpoints must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for errors.\n    57\t- JSON fields are `camelCase`; dates must be ISO 8601 strings.\n    58\t- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; do not introduce `lib/`.\n    59\t\n    60\t### Library/Framework Requirements\n    61\t- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n    62\t- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite; `bcryptjs` for password hashing/verification.\n    63\t- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation.\n    64\t- Next.js App Router + TypeScript; Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (no RTK Query).\n    65\t\n    66\t### File Structure Requirements\n    67\t- Auth helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`.\n    68\t- Session typing: `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n    69\t- Sign-in UI: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`.\n    70\t- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n    71\t\n    72\t### Testing Requirements\n    73\t- Add tests under `tests/api/auth` or `tests/utils` for credential validation logic.\n    74\t- Add component test under `tests/components` for sign-in form validation and error handling.\n    75\t- Include a regression test that verifies post-login redirect to `callbackUrl`.\n    76\t\n    77\t### Previous Story Intelligence\n    78\t- Story 5.1 created the `User` model, admin user creation flow, and uses `bcryptjs` with cost 12.\n    79\t- Admin access currently relies on the legacy creator account (`token.sub === \"creator\"`).\n    80\t- Do not alter user creation behavior; sign-in must be compatible with users created via `/api/users`.\n    81\t\n    82\t### Git Intelligence Summary\n    83\t- Latest work added user management (Story 5.1), new admin UI/API, and Prisma `User` model.\n    84\t- Recent changes touched shared trip views and share link routes; avoid regressions in public share paths.\n    85\t\n    86\t### Latest Tech Information\n    87\t- Verified latest versions via npm: Next.js 16.1.1, Auth.js 4.24.13, Prisma 7.2.0, Redux Toolkit 2.11.2, Zod 4.2.1.\n    88\t- Current project versions already match;
