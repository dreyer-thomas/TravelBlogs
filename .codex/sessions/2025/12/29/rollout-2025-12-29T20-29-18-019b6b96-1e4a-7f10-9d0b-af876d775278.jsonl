Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user,\nI want to sign in with my email and password,\nso that I can access trips based on my role.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I have a valid account\n   **When** I submit the correct email and password\n   **Then** I am signed in and taken to my trips\n2. **Given** I submit invalid credentials\n   **When** I attempt to sign in\n   **Then** I see a clear error\n   **And** I remain signed out\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Update credential authentication to use stored users (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Look up user by email with Prisma and normalize input (trim/lowercase)\n  - [ ] Verify `passwordHash` with `bcryptjs.compare`\n  - [ ] Reject inactive users (`isActive = false`) without revealing account state\n  - [ ] Include `id`, `email`, `role` in the JWT/session for downstream authorization\n- [ ] Align sign-in UI copy and behavior for multi-user access (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Update `/sign-in` messaging from “Creator Access” to user sign-in language\n  - [ ] Keep validation + error messaging consistent with Auth.js error handling\n  - [ ] Redirect to `/trips` or provided `callbackUrl` on success\n- [ ] Add auth tests for sign-in (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Unit test credential validation for valid/invalid/inactive users\n  - [ ] Component test for sign-in form validation + error display\n  - [ ] Regression test for sign-in redirect to callback URL on success\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n- Epic 5 introduces accounts, roles, and authenticated access; this story is the sign-in foundation.\n- Current auth uses Auth.js Credentials + env-based creator login (`CREATOR_EMAIL`, `CREATOR_PASSWORD`) in `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`.\n- User accounts now exist in SQLite via Prisma `User` model with `passwordHash`, `role`, `isActive`.\n- Admin user management (Story 5.1) hashes passwords with `bcryptjs` and treats `token.sub === \"creator\"` as admin.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Replace `validateCredentials` to authenticate against the `User` table using Prisma and `bcryptjs.compare`.\n- Preserve async/await flow and avoid raw Promise chains.\n- Treat invalid credentials and inactive accounts with the same generic error to prevent user enumeration.\n- Ensure JWT/session includes `id`, `email`, and `role` for downstream access checks; update `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` accordingly.\n- Preserve compatibility for the existing creator/admin login until a DB-backed admin user is established (fallback or seed strategy).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- Responses from API endpoints must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for errors.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`; dates must be ISO 8601 strings.\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; do not introduce `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite; `bcryptjs` for password hashing/verification.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation.\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript; Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (no RTK Query).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Auth helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`.\n- Session typing: `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- Sign-in UI: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Add tests under `tests/api/auth` or `tests/utils` for credential validation logic.\n- Add component test under `tests/components` for sign-in form validation and error handling.\n- Include a regression test that verifies post-login redirect to `callbackUrl`.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n- Story 5.1 created the `User` model, admin user creation flow, and uses `bcryptjs` with cost 12.\n- Admin access currently relies on the legacy creator account (`token.sub === \"creator\"`).\n- Do not alter user creation behavior; sign-in must be compatible with users created via `/api/users`.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n- Latest work added user management (Story 5.1), new admin UI/API, and Prisma `User` model.\n- Recent changes touched shared trip views and share link routes; avoid regressions in public share paths.\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n- Verified latest versions via npm: Next.js 16.1.1, Auth.js 4.24.13, Prisma 7.2.0, Redux Toolkit 2.11.2, Zod 4.2.1.\n- Current project versions already match; no upgrades required for this story.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- See `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for mandatory naming, API response shape, test location, and App Router constraints.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### References\n- Epic requirements (Story 5.2) and Epic 5 context: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture decisions, versions, and structure: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide agent rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Current auth implementation: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\n- Sign-in page: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\n- User model + creation API: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/*`\n- `travelblogs/tests/components/*`\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
