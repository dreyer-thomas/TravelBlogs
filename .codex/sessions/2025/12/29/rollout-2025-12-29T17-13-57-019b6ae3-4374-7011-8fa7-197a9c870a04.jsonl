(Phase 1)\nFR18: System can show media in a gallery or carousel within an entry. (Phase 1)\nFR19: Creators can generate a shareable link to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR20: Anyone with the shareable link can view the trip. (Phase 1)\nFR21: Creators can invite specific users to a trip as viewers. (Phase 2)\nFR22: Creators can enable a viewer to contribute to a trip. (Phase 2)\nFR23: Viewers can view trips they are invited to. (Phase 2)\nFR24: Viewers with contribution enabled can add entries to that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR25: Viewers with contribution enabled can edit entries in that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR26: System can display a trip map view with entry locations. (Phase 3)\nFR27: System can display a timeline view tied to map locations. (Phase 3)\nFR28: System can extract coordinates from photo metadata. (Phase 3)\nFR29: Users can view a trip overview with latest entries. (Phase 1)\nFR30: Users can open an entry in a single-page view. (Phase 1)\nFR31: Users can navigate between entries in a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR32: Admin can manage user access and roles. (Phase 2)\nFR33: Admin can deactivate users. (Phase 2)\n\n### MVP Scope Adjustment\n\n- Lightweight authentication is required in MVP to protect creator trip/entry management.\n- This is a scope change from the PRD (which labels auth in Phase 2). Update the PRD when convenient.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Page load time is 5-10 seconds under typical home broadband.\nNFR2: Entry switching response time is under 1 second.\nNFR3: Trip switching response time is 2-5 seconds.\nNFR4: Media upload supports 10-15 files per entry under normal consumer bandwidth.\nNFR5: Use HTTPS for all traffic.\nNFR6: Store passwords using secure hashing when user management is introduced (Phase 2).\nNFR7: Shareable links are unguessable.\nNFR8: Support current versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.\nNFR9: Provide responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers.\nNFR10: Accessibility follows standard good practices (UX specifies WCAG AA).\nNFR11: SPA architecture with no multi-page app requirement.\nNFR12: No SEO requirement; app is private.\nNFR13: No real-time updates; viewers refresh to see new entries.\nNFR14: Optimize media loading and rendering to support fast entry switching.\nNFR15: Enforce role-based access on client and server.\nNFR16: Support small groups up to 15 viewers per trip.\nNFR17: Support low concurrency (2-3 concurrent viewers).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Starter: initialize with `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs` and select TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for styling.\n- Database: SQLite with Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast.\n- UX typography: Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body, body size 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars.\n- UX color tokens: warm terracotta primary, deep teal secondary, ivory/sand surfaces, charcoal text with defined semantic colors.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 5 - Admin creates users  \nFR2: Epic 5 - Role assignment  \nFR3: Epic 5 -

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Lightweight creator sign-in (single account)\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (MVP + Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR0: Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) for trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to generate a shareable link for a trip,\nso that I can invite others to view it without requiring an account.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I generate a shareable link  \n   **Then** I receive a unique, unguessable URL for that trip\n2. **Given** I copy the shareable link and open it  \n   **When** the trip loads  \n   **Then** I can view the trip without signing in\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add a share link data model and migration for per-trip tokens (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Create a singular Prisma model for the trip share link with tripId, token, createdAt\n  - [x] Enforce one active share link per trip (unique tripId + token)\n- [x] Create API support for generating a share link (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a protected POST endpoint under `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n  - [x] Generate a cryptographically random token and return a full share URL in `{ data, error }`\n- [x] Add a public share view route (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Add a read-only route under `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n  - [x] Add a public API route to resolve token → trip overview data\n- [x] Surface the share link in the trip UI (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a Share panel/button in trip detail to create or reveal the link\n  - [x] Show copyable share URL with clear helper text\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n  - Responses must be wrapped as `{ data, error }` with errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; shareable link access must remain public.\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n  - Share links must be unguessable; use cryptographically random tokens (at least 32 bytes) and base64url encode.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (new), `src/app/api/trips/[id]/overview/route.ts` (reference).\n  - UI: `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx` (new), `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share control), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`.\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (new model + migration).\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (allow public share route).\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\n\n### Developer Context: Share Link Flow\n\n- Creator generates link from trip detail (authenticated).\n- Server creates or returns the existing share token for the trip.\n- Public visitor opens `/trips/share/[token]` and receives a read-only trip overview.\n- Public view must not require sign-in and must not expose trip edit actions.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Data model\n  - Add `TripShareLink` model with fields: `id`, `tripId`, `token`, `createdAt`.\n  - Enforce one active share link per trip (unique `tripId`).\n  - Token must be unique (unique `token`).\n- Creator API\n  - `POST /api/trips/[id]/share-link` requires creator auth.\n  - If a share link exists for the trip, return it; otherwise create one.\n  - Response: `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }`.\n- Public API\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` (or similar) does not require auth.\n  - Resolve token to trip + entries for read-only view.\n  - Return 404 for invalid token; do not leak whether a trip exists.\n- UI\n  - Trip detail page shows a Share action.\n  - If link exists, show it with copy-to-clipboard.\n  - If not, allow creator to generate it.\n  - Public share page uses the same Trip Overview UI pattern (latest entries first).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; new public share page lives under `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n- Use `next-auth/jwt` for creator endpoints; no auth for public share route.\n- Keep data access through Prisma; do not bypass models.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Use `crypto` from Node.js for token generation (`crypto.randomBytes`).\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }`.\n- Use Next.js Image for cover images and media thumbnails.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes:\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` for creator link generation.\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts` for public resolution.\n- UI routes:\n  - `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx` for public trip view.\n- Components:\n  - Add any new share UI under `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add tests in `tests/api` for:\n  - creator share link creation (auth required).\n  - public share resolution (no auth).\n  - invalid token returns 404 with `{ data: null, error }`.\n- Add a UI test in `tests/components` for Share panel (render link + copy).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - API routes under `src/app/api`.\n  - New share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - Current middleware blocks all `/trips/*` paths; must allow `/trips/share/[token]` explicitly.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria.

API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n  - Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; public share access stays unauthenticated.\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n  - Performance targets: share link regeneration should be fast; public share resolve must keep entry switching under 1s and trip load 2-5s.\n  - Deployment constraints: no Docker or TLS proxy in MVP; `.env` + bare Node process on NAS only.\n  - Integration patterns: public share uses existing trip overview resolver and media gallery patterns; avoid introducing new external services.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (extend or add regenerate route)\n  - API (public): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts` (ensure invalid old token fails)\n  - UI: `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share panel), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (TripShareLink already exists)\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (share route already allowed; avoid regressions)\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\n\n### Developer Context: Share Link Rotation Flow\n\n- Creator requests regeneration from trip detail (authenticated).\n- Server rotates token on the single `TripShareLink` row for the trip.\n- Old token must no longer resolve; public route returns 404/denied.\n- New token resolves to the same public trip overview (read-only).\n\n### Epic Context & Dependencies\n\n- Epic 4 goal: enable frictionless sharing without accounts; share links must remain unguessable and public-view friendly.\n- Dependencies: Story 4.1 share link generation and public share page already exist and must be extended, not replaced.\n- Do not introduce any new auth gates for `/trips/share/[token]`.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Data model\n  - Reuse `TripShareLink` with unique `tripId` and `token`.\n  - Regeneration updates `token` and `createdAt` (or add `updatedAt` if present).\n- Creator API\n  - Endpoint must require creator auth + ownership.\n  - If no share link exists, either create then rotate, or return a clear error (align with UI behavior).\n  - Response: `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }`.\n- Public API\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` must return 404/denied for revoked tokens.\n  - Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid.\n- UI\n  - Confirm before regeneration (destructive action).\n  - Update the displayed link and copy state immediately after success.\n  - Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n- Use Prisma for persistence; no direct DB access bypass.\n- Keep public share routes unauthenticated.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Use Node `crypto.randomBytes` for token generation.\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media thumbnails in shared views.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes under `src/app/api`:\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` or `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/regenerate/route.ts`\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n- UI components under `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests in `tests/api`:\n  - Regenerate rotates token and returns new URL.\n  - Old token resolves to 404/denied.\n- Tests in `tests/components`:\n  - Share panel shows regenerate action and updates displayed URL.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - API routes under `src/app/api`.\n  - New share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - None expected; reuse existing share link flow and public share route.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.1 already introduced `TripShareLink` and the public share page.\n- Share link generation uses `crypto.randomBytes` and returns a full share URL.\n- Middleware explicitly allows `/trips/share/[token]` to remain public.\n- Recent bugs fixed in shared view: ensure entry media/gallery and clickability remain intact.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits touched shared trip view (`src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`) and entry reader/media gallery.\n- Share link flow and public share API/tests already exist and follow response wrapper conventions.\n- Regression risk: changes to share panel or share page should avoid breaking media gallery behavior or click targets.\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- No external web research completed (network access not enabled). If needed, confirm library changes for Auth.js, Prisma, or Next.js before implementation.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria.

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to revoke a trip's shareable link,\nso that the trip is no longer accessible via that link.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own\n   **When** I revoke the shareable link\n   **Then** the link is disabled and no longer grants access\n2. **Given** I open a revoked link\n   **When** the trip is requested\n   **Then** I see an access denied or not found message\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Implement revoke API for a trip share link (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Choose REST shape under App Router (e.g., `DELETE /api/trips/[id]/share-link` or `PATCH /api/trips/[id]/share-link` with action)\n  - [x] Require creator auth + trip ownership checks (reuse existing share-link auth/ownership helpers)\n  - [x] Revoke by removing the `TripShareLink` record (preferred) or marking it revoked in a safe, queryable way\n  - [x] Return `{ data: { revoked: true, tripId }, error: null }` and keep ISO 8601 dates if included\n- [x] Ensure public share endpoints reject revoked links (AC: 2)\n  - [x] `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` returns 404/denied for revoked or missing token\n  - [x] `GET /api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]` also rejects revoked tokens\n  - [x] Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid\n- [x] Update share UI to allow revocation (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a destructive \"Revoke link\" action in the share panel with confirm modal\n  - [x] Clear displayed link state after revoke and show \"Link revoked\" status\n  - [x] Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1-2)\n  - [x] API test: revoke removes or invalidates token and returns expected response\n  - [x] API test: revoked token returns 404/denied on public share routes\n  - [x] UI test: share panel shows revoke action + updates state after revoke\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n  - Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; public share access stays unauthenticated.\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n  - Performance targets: public share resolve must keep entry switching under 1s and trip load 2-5s.\n  - Deployment constraints: no Docker or TLS proxy in MVP; `.env` + bare Node process on NAS only.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (extend with DELETE/PATCH revoke)\n  - API (public): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n  - API (public entries): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]/route.ts`\n  - UI: `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share panel), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (TripShareLink; no schema change required if deleting row)\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (keep share routes public; avoid regressions)\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\n\n### Developer Context: Share Link Revocation Flow\n\n- Creator clicks \"Revoke link\" from trip detail share panel.\n- Server validates creator auth + ownership, revokes the `TripShareLink` row.\n- Public share routes must deny access for revoked or missing tokens.\n- UI should show revoked state and allow creating a new link via existing create/regenerate flow.\n\n### Epic Context & Dependencies\n\n- Epic 4 goal: frictionless sharing without accounts; revocation must not require sign-in for public share routes.\n- Depends on Story 4.1 (create share link) and Story 4.2 (regenerate link) for shared link model and UI patterns.\n- Reuse existing share link resolver and share panel instead of adding parallel flows.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Data model\n  - Prefer deleting `TripShareLink` to revoke; ensure Prisma delete is scoped by tripId and owner.\n  - If using a revoke flag instead, keep token unique and ensure public queries ignore revoked tokens.\n- Creator API\n  - Endpoint must require creator auth + ownership.\n  - Response: `{ data: { revoked: true, tripId }, error: null }`.\n- Public API\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` must return 404/denied for revoked tokens.\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]` must also reject revoked tokens.\n  - Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid.\n- UI\n  - Confirm before revoke (destructive action).\n  - Clear link display after revoke and show revoked state.\n  - Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n- Use Prisma for persistence; no direct DB access bypass.\n- Keep public share routes unauthenticated.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Use Node `crypto.randomBytes` only if a new token is generated in the revoke flow (avoid unnecessary regeneration).\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }` wrapper.\n- Use Next.js Image for media thumbnails in shared views.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes under `src/app/api`:\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]/route.ts`\n- UI components under `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests in `tests/api`:\n  - Revoke removes or invalidates token and returns expected response.\n  - Revoked token returns 404/denied on public share routes.\n- Tests in `tests/components`:\n  - Share panel shows revoke action and updates display state.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - API routes under `src/app/api` and tests under `tests/`.\n  - Share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - None expected; extend existing share link flow and public share routes.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.2 implemented share link regeneration with token rotation and updated public share guards.\n- Share link generation uses `crypto.randomBytes` and returns a full share URL.\n- Middleware explicitly allows `/trips/share/[token]` to remain public.\n- Recent fixes were made to shared trip view clickability and media gallery rendering; avoid regressions in shared views.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits touched shared trip view (`src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`) and entry reader/media gallery.\n- Share link flow and public share API/tests already exist and follow response wrapper conventions.\n- Regression risk: changes to share panel or share page should avoid breaking media gallery behavior or click targets.\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- No external web research completed (network access not enabled). Use project-specified versions for Next.js, Prisma, Auth.js, Redux Toolkit, and Zod.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria.

The remaining gaps are UI emphasis and a prior edge-case bug where old links still worked on a story page.\\n\\n## What Went Well\\n- End-to-end share flow shipped (create, public view, revoke).\\n- Strong API and UI test coverage for share access and invalid tokens.\\n- Public share view aligned with read-only UX.\\n\\n## Challenges\\n- Token invalidation edge case on story page (old link still worked after rotation/revocation).\\n- Share controls felt too prominent in the trip UI.\\n- Multiple surfaces touched for share flow (API, UI, middleware, tests), increasing regression risk.\\n\\n## Key Insights\\n- Public share routes are a high-sensitivity area and need consistent invalidation rules across overview and entry views.\\n- UI polish can lag functional completeness; keep them decoupled as separate follow-up work.\\n\\n## Action Items\\n1. Fix share token invalidation on story page (old link must never work after regeneration/revoke)\\n   - Owner: Amelia (Dev)\\n   - Success: Old token returns 404 on all share routes and entry pages; regression test added\\n\\n2. Share UI refinement to be more discreet\\n   - Owner: Sally (UX)\\n   - Changes:\\n     - Share control becomes a small icon/button in trip header (lower right beside Owner label)\\n     - Revoke moves to Trip Actions area at the bottom\\n     - Remove Regenerate action entirely (Revoke + Generate only)\\n\\n3. Mixed-access test coverage (public share vs authenticated roles)\\n   - Owner: Murat (QA)\\n   - Success: Test cases cover shared link access + signed-in role access with no regressions\\n\\n## Next Epic Preview (Epic 5)\\nEpic 5 introduces authenticated multi-user roles (admin/creator/viewer) and trip-level permissions. The share foundation remains public and must stay isolated from authenticated role flows.\\n\\n## Preparation Notes\\n- No critical prep work identified.\\n- Parallel prep: maintain strict separation between public share routes and authenticated routes; expand mixed-access tests.\\n- Nice-to-have: UI guidance to avoid share controls dominating trip detail UX.\\n\\n## Readiness Assessment\\n- Testing & Quality: Acceptable; no concerns raised\\n- Deployment: Live in production\\n- Stakeholder Acceptance: Confirmed\\n- Technical Health: Stable\\n- Unresolved Blockers: None identified\\n\\n## Significant Discoveries\\n- None that require changes to Epic 5 scope or assumptions.\\n\\n## Commitments\\n- Complete action items before or during early Epic 5 work as noted above.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_9yC6idPJddkLTzsgVZUkJ5nm"}}

Full Epic Loading\n\n**Strategy**: Sprint planning needs ALL epics and stories to build complete status tracking.\n\n**Epic Discovery Process:**\n\n1. **Search for whole document first** - Look for `epics.md`, `bmm-epics.md`, or any `*epic*.md` file\n2. **Check for sharded version** - If whole document not found, look for `epics/index.md`\n3. **If sharded version found**:\n   - Read `index.md` to understand the document structure\n   - Read ALL epic section files listed in the index (e.g., `epic-1.md`, `epic-2.md`, etc.)\n   - Process all epics and their stories from the combined content\n   - This ensures complete sprint status coverage\n4. **Priority**: If both whole and sharded versions exist, use the whole document\n\n**Fuzzy matching**: Be flexible with document names - users may use variations like `epics.md`, `bmm-epics.md`, `user-stories.md`, etc.\n\n<workflow>\n\n<step n=\"1\" goal=\"Parse epic files and extract all work items\">\n<action>Communicate in {communication_language} with {user_name}</action>\n<action>Look for all files matching `{epics_pattern}` in {epics_location}</action>\n<action>Could be a single `epics.md` file or multiple `epic-1.md`, `epic-2.md` files</action>\n\n<action>For each epic file found, extract:</action>\n\n- Epic numbers from headers like `## Epic 1:` or `## Epic 2:`\n- Story IDs and titles from patterns like `### Story 1.1: User Authentication`\n- Convert story format from `Epic.Story: Title` to kebab-case key: `epic-story-title`\n\n**Story ID Conversion Rules:**\n\n- Original: `### Story 1.1: User Authentication`\n- Replace period with dash: `1-1`\n- Convert title to kebab-case: `user-authentication`\n- Final key: `1-1-user-authentication`\n\n<action>Build complete inventory of all epics and stories from all epic files</action>\n</step>\n\n  <step n=\"0.5\" goal=\"Discover and load project documents\">\n    <invoke-protocol name=\"discover_inputs\" />\n    <note>After discovery, these content variables are available: {epics_content} (all epics loaded -
