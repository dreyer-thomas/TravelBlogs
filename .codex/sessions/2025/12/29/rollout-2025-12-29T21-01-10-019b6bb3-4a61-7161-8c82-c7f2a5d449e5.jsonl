Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs an admin,\nI want to change a user's role between creator and viewer,\nso that access aligns with their responsibilities.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as an admin\n   **When** I update a user's role\n   **Then** the new role is saved and shown in the user list\n2. **Given** I attempt to change the role with invalid input\n   **When** I save\n   **Then** I see a clear validation error\n   **And** the role is not updated\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add role update API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Create a `PATCH /api/users/:id` route handler under `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Validate payload with Zod (`role` required; enum: `creator | viewer`)\n  - [ ] Enforce admin access using existing Auth.js token checks (`token.sub === \"creator\"`)\n  - [ ] Update Prisma `User` record and return `{ data, error }` response shape\n  - [ ] Return validation/authorization errors in `{ error: { code, message } }` format\n- [ ] Add admin UI for role change (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add role selector and save action in `src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`\n  - [ ] Update UI state optimistically on success; surface errors on failure\n  - [ ] Prevent role updates for the current admin if needed (confirm behavior)\n- [ ] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests for role update success, invalid role, and unauthorized access\n  - [ ] Component test for role change UI + error handling\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Epic 5 introduces accounts, roles, and authenticated access; this story adds role switching for existing users.\n- Admin access currently relies on the legacy creator account (`token.sub === \"creator\"`).\n- The admin users dashboard already lists users and shows a role badge, but has no edit controls yet.\n- `/api/users` supports `GET` and `POST` only; there is no update route for user roles.\n- Prisma `User` model stores `role` as `UserRole` enum (`creator`, `viewer`).\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: Complete Phase 2 account and role management, including admin management, sign-in, and per-trip access control.\n- Related stories: 5.1 Admin creates user accounts; 5.2 User sign-in; 5.4 Invite viewers to a trip; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips; 5.7 Contributor adds/edits entries; 5.8 Admin deactivates user.\n- Business value: Admins can maintain correct access roles so creator-only actions and viewer-only access remain secure and predictable.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires 5.1 user creation flow and `User` model (role already persisted).\n- Assumes 5.2 sign-in flow sets `token.sub`, `token.role`, `token.email` for admin gating and downstream UI.\n- Upcoming stories 5.4–5.7 depend on accurate user roles for access enforcement.\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse admin gating logic used in `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts` (token-based admin check).\n- Reuse UI styling and layout patterns from `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx` and `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-form.tsx` to keep admin UI consistent.\n- Reuse API response helpers and error formatting patterns from existing admin endpoints; do not introduce a new response shape.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API route handlers live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`; new role update route should be `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Admin UI components live in `travelblogs/src/components/admin/` (update `user-list.tsx` and related components as needed).\n- Admin page fetches users server-side in `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` and passes data into `UsersDashboard`.\n- Shared helpers should remain in `travelblogs/src/utils/`; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements (Story 5.3) and Epic 5 context: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture decisions, versions, and structure: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide agent rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Current admin users API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\n- Admin UI components: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-form.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/users-dashboard.tsx`\n- Admin users page: `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`\n- User model: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add `PATCH` handler at `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` with Zod validation for `role`.\n- Keep API response shape `{ data, error }` and error payload `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Use async/await; do not introduce raw Promise chains.\n- Preserve generic error messaging for unauthorized access (no user enumeration).\n- Do not allow role changes to modify password or activation status.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`; dates returned from API must be ISO 8601 strings.\n- Use `travelblogs/src/utils/` for shared helpers; do not add `lib/`.\n - Performance/deployment/integration constraints: no special requirements for this story beyond existing app standards (admin-only UI + API).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for admin gating.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite for user updates.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation.\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript; Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (no RTK Query).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API route: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Admin UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx` and related admin components.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests: role update success, invalid role payload, unauthorized or non-admin access.\n- Component tests: role selector interaction, success state update, error messaging.\n- Add a regression test that ensures creator-only admin gating still blocks non-admin users.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.2 moved credential validation to Prisma + bcrypt and expanded session typing in `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- Admin access remains tied to `token.sub === \"creator\"`; keep this gating consistent in the new PATCH route.\n- User creation uses `bcryptjs` with cost 12 in `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`; role updates must not touch `passwordHash`.\n- Admin UI patterns: the user list cards and form styles in `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx` and `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-form.tsx` set the visual baseline to follow.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added: admin users API/UI (`travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/*`), user model (`travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`), and sign-in updates (`travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`).\n- Avoid regressions in admin dashboard layout and Auth.js callbacks that set `session.user.role`.\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed (network restricted); project already pins versions in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### UX Notes (Admin UI)\n\n- Keep admin actions secondary in visual hierarchy; follow existing admin dashboard look and spacing.\n- Role selector should be compact, inline with the role badge styling, and use the existing color tokens.\n- Use inline validation/error messaging consistent with the user creation form.\n\n### Verification & Completion Guardrails\n\n- Verify PATCH response returns updated user role and preserves existing fields.\n- Confirm list updates show the new role immediately (refresh or optimistic UI).\n- Ensure non-admins receive a 403 and do not see role change controls.\n\n### Scope Boundaries\n\n- Do not add new roles beyond `creator` and `viewer`.\n- Do not change authentication flows or user creation behavior.\n- Do not add or modify trip invite or contributor logic (covered in later stories).\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming conventions, response formats, API routing, and test location rules.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n[TBD_DEBUG_LOG]\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-3-admin-changes-user-role.md`\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs an admin,\nI want to change a user's role between creator and viewer,\nso that access aligns with their responsibilities.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as an admin\n   **When** I update a user's role\n   **Then** the new role is saved and shown in the user list\n2. **Given** I attempt to change the role with invalid input\n   **When** I save\n   **Then** I see a clear validation error\n   **And** the role is not updated\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add role update API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Create a `PATCH /api/users/:id` route handler under `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [x] Validate payload with Zod (`role` required; enum: `creator | viewer`)\n  - [x] Enforce admin access using existing Auth.js token checks (`token.sub === \"creator\"`)\n  - [x] Update Prisma `User` record and return `{ data, error }` response shape\n  - [x] Return validation/authorization errors in `{ error: { code, message } }` format\n- [x] Add admin UI for role change (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add role selector and save action in `src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`\n  - [x] Update UI state optimistically on success; surface errors on failure\n  - [x] Prevent role updates for the current admin if needed (confirm behavior)\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests for role update success, invalid role, and unauthorized access\n  - [x] Component test for role change UI + error handling\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Epic 5 introduces accounts, roles, and authenticated access; this story adds role switching for existing users.\n- Admin access currently relies on the legacy creator account (`token.sub === \"creator\"`).\n- The admin users dashboard already lists users and shows a role badge, but has no edit controls yet.\n- `/api/users` supports `GET` and `POST` only; there is no update route for user roles.\n- Prisma `User` model stores `role` as `UserRole` enum (`creator`, `viewer`).\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: Complete Phase 2 account and role management, including admin management, sign-in, and per-trip access control.\n- Related stories: 5.1 Admin creates user accounts; 5.2 User sign-in; 5.4 Invite viewers to a trip; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips; 5.7 Contributor adds/edits entries; 5.8 Admin deactivates user.\n- Business value: Admins can maintain correct access roles so creator-only actions and viewer-only access remain secure and predictable.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires 5.1 user creation flow and `User` model (role already persisted).\n- Assumes 5.2 sign-in flow sets `token.sub`, `token.role`, `token.email` for admin gating and downstream UI.\n- Upcoming stories 5.4–5.7 depend on accurate user roles for access enforcement.\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse admin gating logic used in `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts` (token-based admin check).\n- Reuse UI styling and layout patterns from `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx` and `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-form.tsx` to keep admin UI consistent.\n- Reuse API response helpers and error formatting patterns from existing admin endpoints; do not introduce a new response shape.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API route handlers live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`; new role update route should be `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Admin UI components live in `travelblogs/src/components/admin/` (update `user-list.tsx` and related components as needed).\n- Admin page fetches users server-side in `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` and passes data into `UsersDashboard`.\n- Shared helpers should remain in `travelblogs/src/utils/`; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements (Story 5.3) and Epic 5 context: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture decisions, versions, and structure: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide agent rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Current admin users API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\n- Admin UI components: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-form.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/users-dashboard.tsx`\n- Admin users page: `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`\n- User model: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add `PATCH` handler at `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` with Zod validation for `role`.\n- Keep API response shape `{ data, error }` and error payload `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Use async/await; do not introduce raw Promise chains.\n- Preserve generic error messaging for unauthorized access (no user enumeration).\n- Do not allow role changes to modify password or activation status.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`; dates returned from API must be ISO 8601 strings.\n- Use `travelblogs/src/utils/` for shared helpers; do not add `lib/`.\n - Performance/deployment/integration constraints: no special requirements for this story beyond existing app standards (admin-only UI + API).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for admin gating.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite for user updates.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation.\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript; Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (no RTK Query).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API route: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Admin UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx` and related admin components.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests: role update success, invalid role payload, unauthorized or non-admin access.\n- Component tests: role selector interaction, success state update, error messaging.\n- Add a regression test that ensures creator-only admin gating still blocks non-admin users.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n"}}
