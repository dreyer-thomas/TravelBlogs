Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to generate a shareable link for a trip,\nso that I can invite others to view it without requiring an account.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I generate a shareable link  \n   **Then** I receive a unique, unguessable URL for that trip\n2. **Given** I copy the shareable link and open it  \n   **When** the trip loads  \n   **Then** I can view the trip without signing in\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add a share link data model and migration for per-trip tokens (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Create a singular Prisma model for the trip share link with tripId, token, createdAt\n  - [ ] Enforce one active share link per trip (unique tripId + token)\n- [ ] Create API support for generating a share link (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Add a protected POST endpoint under `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Generate a cryptographically random token and return a full share URL in `{ data, error }`\n- [ ] Add a public share view route (AC: 2)\n  - [ ] Add a read-only route under `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n  - [ ] Add a public API route to resolve token → trip overview data\n- [ ] Surface the share link in the trip UI (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Add a Share panel/button in trip detail to create or reveal the link\n  - [ ] Show copyable share URL with clear helper text\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n  - Responses must be wrapped as `{ data, error }` with errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; shareable link access must remain public.\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n  - Share links must be unguessable; use cryptographically random tokens (at least 32 bytes) and base64url encode.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (new), `src/app/api/trips/[id]/overview/route.ts` (reference).\n  - UI: `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx` (new), `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share control), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`.\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (new model + migration).\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (allow public share route).\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\n\n### Developer Context: Share Link Flow\n\n- Creator generates link from trip detail (authenticated).\n- Server creates or returns the existing share token for the trip.\n- Public visitor opens `/trips/share/[token]` and receives a read-only trip overview.\n- Public view must not require sign-in and must not expose trip edit actions.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Data model\n  - Add `TripShareLink` model with fields: `id`, `tripId`, `token`, `createdAt`.\n  - Enforce one active share link per trip (unique `tripId`).\n  - Token must be unique (unique `token`).\n- Creator API\n  - `POST /api/trips/[id]/share-link` requires creator auth.\n  - If a share link exists for the trip, return it; otherwise create one.\n  - Response: `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }`.\n- Public API\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` (or similar) does not require auth.\n  - Resolve token to trip + entries for read-only view.\n  - Return 404 for invalid token; do not leak whether a trip exists.\n- UI\n  - Trip detail page shows a Share action.\n  - If link exists, show it with copy-to-clipboard.\n  - If not, allow creator to generate it.\n  - Public share page uses the same Trip Overview UI pattern (latest entries first).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; new public share page lives under `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n- Use `next-auth/jwt` for creator endpoints; no auth for public share route.\n- Keep data access through Prisma; do not bypass models.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Use `crypto` from Node.js for token generation (`crypto.randomBytes`).\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }`.\n- Use Next.js Image for cover images and media thumbnails.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes:\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` for creator link generation.\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts` for public resolution.\n- UI routes:\n  - `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx` for public trip view.\n- Components:\n  - Add any new share UI under `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add tests in `tests/api` for:\n  - creator share link creation (auth required).\n  - public share resolution (no auth).\n  - invalid token returns 404 with `{ data: null, error }`.\n- Add a UI test in `tests/components` for Share panel (render link + copy).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - API routes under `src/app/api`.\n  - New share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - Current middleware blocks all `/trips/*` paths; must allow `/trips/share/[token]` explicitly.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Epic 4: Simple Sharing]\n- Shareable links must be unguessable; public viewing requires no sign-in. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 4.1: Create Shareable Trip Link]\n- Architecture constraints: App Router, REST API patterns, auth, Prisma, error format. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Core Architectural Decisions]\n- Global agent rules for API response format, naming, tests, and routes. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- N/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### File List\n\n- prisma/schema.prisma\n- src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts\n- src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts\n- src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx\n- src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- src/middleware.ts\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
