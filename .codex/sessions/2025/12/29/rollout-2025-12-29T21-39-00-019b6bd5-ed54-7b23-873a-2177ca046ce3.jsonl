Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to invite specific users to a trip as viewers,\nso that only chosen people can access it.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own\n   **When** I invite an existing user as a viewer\n   **Then** the user is added to the trip's viewer list\n   **And** they can access the trip once signed in\n2. **Given** I invite a user who does not exist\n   **When** I submit the invite\n   **Then** I see a clear error\n   **And** the invite is not created\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add trip viewer access model (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Add a join model for trip access (e.g., `TripAccess`) with `tripId`, `userId`, `canContribute` (default false), `createdAt`\n  - [ ] Enforce unique constraint on `tripId + userId`\n  - [ ] Create Prisma migration and update schema\n- [ ] Create invite API endpoints (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `GET /api/trips/:id/viewers` to list invited viewers for the trip (creator-only, owner-only)\n  - [ ] Add `POST /api/trips/:id/viewers` to invite a viewer by email\n  - [ ] Validate request with Zod (email required, normalized to lowercase)\n  - [ ] Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures\n  - [ ] If user not found or inactive, return `404 NOT_FOUND` with a clear message\n  - [ ] If user exists but is not a viewer, return `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`\n  - [ ] If viewer already invited, return existing entry (idempotent) rather than creating duplicates\n- [ ] Allow invited viewers to access the trip content (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Update trip detail and entries access checks to allow invited viewers\n  - [ ] Keep creator-only behavior for write actions\n- [ ] Add invite UI to trip detail (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Extend `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` share panel to include an \"Invite viewers\" section\n  - [ ] Display current invited viewers (name + email)\n  - [ ] Provide email input + invite button\n  - [ ] Show validation errors inline, consistent with existing share panel styling\n- [ ] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests: invite success, invite unknown user, invite non-viewer, idempotent invite, access list gated to creator + trip owner\n  - [ ] API tests: viewer access allowed for invited trip detail and entries\n  - [ ] Component tests: invite panel renders, sends invite, shows errors, and lists invited viewers\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Epic 5 introduces user accounts, roles, and per-trip access control. This story is the first piece of per-trip access (viewer invites).\n- Current access checks are creator-only for trip CRUD and entries write; viewer read access must be gated by trip membership.\n- Creator account is still the admin gate (`token.sub === \"creator\"`). Viewer accounts use their Prisma `User.id` as `token.sub`.\n- Trip sharing via token already exists; invited viewers are separate from public share links.\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: complete Phase 2 account + role management, including viewer access and contributor permissions.\n- Related stories: 5.1 Admin creates users; 5.2 User sign-in; 5.3 Admin changes user role; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips; 5.7 Contributor adds/edits entries; 5.8 Admin deactivates user.\n- Business value: creators can safely share trips with known viewers without public links.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires user accounts from 5.1 and sign-in from 5.2 (viewer users already exist in DB).\n- Builds the data model needed for 5.5 (contributor flag) and 5.6 (viewer trip list).\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse JSON error shape and Zod validation patterns from `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` and `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Reuse admin/creator gating pattern (`token.sub === \"creator\"`) from existing admin APIs.\n- Reuse share panel layout, button styling, and inline error treatment in `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `src/app/api` only; use plural paths like `/trips/:id/viewers`.\n- Components live under `src/components/<feature>/` (trip UI in `src/components/trips/`).\n- Tests live under `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Shared helpers belong in `src/utils/`; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture decisions and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- UX specs for share/invite behavior and hierarchy: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip detail + share UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Trip API patterns: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n- Share link API patterns: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n- User role validation patterns: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add a `TripAccess` (or equivalent) model that maps a `User` to a `Trip` with `canContribute` boolean.\n- Enforce unique membership per user per trip; treat repeated invites as idempotent.\n- Invite request body shape: `{ email: string }` (lowercase + trimmed).\n- Only the trip owner (creator) can invite; return `403 FORBIDDEN` otherwise.\n- Response format must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Viewer access should be read-only; keep creator-only checks for create/update/delete endpoints.\n- Dates returned from API must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation.\n- Use async/await (no raw Promise chains).\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Prisma schema update: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- New API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts` (and any subroutes if needed).\n- Trip UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for invite creation, unknown user, non-viewer user, and idempotent invites.\n- API tests that invited viewers can read trip details and entries while non-invited viewers are blocked.\n- Component tests for invite panel interaction and error display.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Admin gating remains `token.sub === \"creator\"`; keep this consistent for invite endpoints.\n- User creation and role changes are already implemented; do not change user creation flow.\n- Admin UI styling patterns (small caps, muted text) should guide invite UI styling for consistency.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added admin user management and sign-in (Auth.js + Prisma user model).\n- Avoid regressions in admin dashboard layout and auth callbacks that set `session.user.role`.\n- Tests are Vitest-based and use Prisma test databases with `prisma migrate deploy` in setup.\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed (network restricted); use versions pinned in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming conventions, response formats, API routing, and test location rules.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n### File List\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

This story is the first piece of per-trip access (viewer invites).\n- Current access checks are creator-only for trip CRUD and entries write; viewer read access must be gated by trip membership.\n- Creator account is still the admin gate (`token.sub === \"creator\"`). Viewer accounts use their Prisma `User.id` as `token.sub`.\n- Trip sharing via token already exists; invited viewers are separate from public share links.\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: complete Phase 2 account + role management, including viewer access and contributor permissions.\n- Related stories: 5.1 Admin creates users; 5.2 User sign-in; 5.3 Admin changes user role; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips; 5.7 Contributor adds/edits entries; 5.8 Admin deactivates user.\n- Business value: creators can safely share trips with known viewers without public links.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires user accounts from 5.1 and sign-in from 5.2 (viewer users already exist in DB).\n- Builds the data model needed for 5.5 (contributor flag) and 5.6 (viewer trip list).\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse JSON error shape and Zod validation patterns from `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` and `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Reuse admin/creator gating pattern (`token.sub === \"creator\"`) from existing admin APIs.\n- Reuse share panel layout, button styling, and inline error treatment in `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `src/app/api` only; use plural paths like `/trips/:id/viewers`.\n- Components live under `src/components/<feature>/` (trip UI in `src/components/trips/`).\n- Tests live under `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Shared helpers belong in `src/utils/`; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture decisions and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- UX specs for share/invite behavior and hierarchy: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip detail + share UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\nYou must fully embody this agent's persona and follow all activation instructions exactly as specified.
