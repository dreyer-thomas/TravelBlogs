Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to open an entry in a single-page reader with a media-first layout,\nso that I can consume the day's story quickly.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I have access to a trip, when I open an entry, then I see the entry on a single page with media displayed prominently.\n2. Given I have access to a trip, when I open an entry, then the entry text is readable without navigating to another page.\n3. Given the entry includes multiple media files, when the entry loads, then media is displayed in the entry view in a gallery or carousel.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Build single-page entry reader layout (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Create/extend `EntryReader` component with media-first layout and readable body typography\n  - [x] Implement media gallery/carousel UI for multiple files\n  - [x] Ensure entry content renders in one page (no secondary routes)\n- [x] Fetch and render entry data (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Load entry by `id` via App Router `page.tsx` (server component + `fetch`)\n  - [x] Map API response into `EntryReader` props with `camelCase` fields\n- [x] Accessibility and performance pass (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Ensure focus states, keyboard navigation, and 44x44 targets\n  - [x] Use `next/image` with lazy loading; avoid layout shifts\n  - [x] Verify entry switching stays under 1s in typical media sizes\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- Media-first, single-page reading experience; no navigation between entries in this story (that is Story 3.2).\n- Prioritize immersion and readability: large media presence, clear text flow, minimal chrome.\n- UX targets: body text 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars, Fraunces headings + Source Serif 4 body.\n- Accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus, 44x44 targets, strong contrast.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 goal: fast, media-first entry reading with clear navigation; this story covers the single-page reader only.\n- Depends on existing entry data and media upload flows from Epic 2 (entries/media must already exist).\n- Do not implement entry-to-entry navigation or trip overview here; those are Stories 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Entry data must render in a single App Router page without secondary navigation.\n- Media-first definition: first media item renders as full-width hero above the text; remaining media render in a horizontal carousel below the hero.\n- Use `next/image` with lazy loading for media, and avoid layout shift.\n- Error responses and UI must use `{ data, error }` response shape and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; entry view lives under `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- REST API read via `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` and `fetch`.\n- Use server components for data fetching; client components only if interactivity requires it.\n- Validation is server-side only (Zod).\n- Access control must be enforced server-side (viewer access via shareable link or authenticated role/ACL).\n- Deployment/Env: No special deployment steps required for this story; use existing `.env` conventions and App Router build defaults.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS styling.\n- Redux Toolkit patterns if client state needed (avoid RTK Query).\n- Zod for server validation if request params are validated.\n- Latest-version verification not performed; use pinned versions from architecture and project context.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Explicitly Deferred)\n- No web research performed in this story. Do not change library versions; follow pinned versions in `/_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `/_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Versioned Stack (Authoritative for This Story)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Expect entry to include: `id`, `tripId`, `title` (or date/title), `body`, `media[]`, `createdAt` (ISO 8601).\n- Media items should include at minimum: `id`, `url`, `type` (image/video), `width`, `height`, `alt` (if available).\n- API response must remain `{ data, error }`; on not found or unauthorized, return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }`.\n- Align field names and types with `prisma/schema.prisma`; do not invent fields not present in the schema.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry reader UI: `src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx`.\n- Media gallery UI: `src/components/media/media-gallery.tsx`.\n- Shared UI atoms in `src/components/ui/`.\n- Utilities in `src/utils/`; avoid creating new `lib/`.\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Do not create duplicate reader or gallery components; extend `EntryReader` and `media-gallery` if they exist.\n- Reuse shared UI atoms (buttons, modals) instead of new bespoke variants.\n- Avoid embedding API calls inside presentational components; keep data loading in `page.tsx`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- If component tests exist, add/extend `tests/components/entries/*`.\n- API tests (if added) go under `tests/api/` and must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not implement entry navigation, trip overview, map/timeline, or sharing UI in this story.\n- Do not add new auth flows; rely on existing access control at API level.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Aligns with defined structure: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/entries/`, `src/components/media/`.\n- No new structure conflicts anticipated; keep files `kebab-case.tsx`, components `PascalCase`.\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.1: View Entry (Single-Page Reader)]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Visual Design Foundation]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Components `PascalCase`, files `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n- Use `next/image` and lazy loading for media.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Create `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx` server component to fetch `/api/entries/:id`\n- Normalize API response to `EntryReader` props via `src/utils/entry-reader.ts`\n- Surface load errors in-page and reuse `EntryReader` for rendering\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n- Built `EntryReader` with media-first hero layout and readable body typography\n- Added `MediaGallery` carousel for additional media items\n- Tests: `npm test`\n- Added App Router entry reader page with server-side fetch and mapping util\n- Tests: `npm test`\n- Verified gallery controls and image loading attributes; ensured hero uses explicit dimensions\n- Tests: `npm test`\n- Enabled public entry viewing flow; ordered media responses and inferred media types for reader mapping\n- Rendered inline images in reader body and added coverage for public entry access\n- Tests: `npm test`\n\n### File List\n\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/media/media-gallery.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/entry-reader.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/media-gallery.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/utils/entry-reader.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/utils/entry-reader-mapper.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/get-entry.test.ts\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-28: Added single-page entry reader, media gallery, entry mapping, and coverage for reader/gallery behavior.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: done\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to navigate between entries in a trip,\nso that I can move through the story in order.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I am viewing an entry in a trip, when I select next or previous entry, then I am taken to that entry without leaving the entry reader.\n2. Given I am viewing an entry in a trip, when I select next or previous entry, then the entry content updates within the single-page view.\n3. Given I am on the first or last entry, when I attempt to navigate past the bounds, then the unavailable direction is disabled or clearly indicated.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add navigation metadata to the public entry read flow (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Extend `GET /api/entries/[id]` to return adjacent entry IDs (and optional titles/dates) in chronological order\n  - [x] Ensure navigation respects the same trip ordering used in trip timelines (oldest → newest)\n  - [x] Keep `{ data, error }` response shape and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- [x] Update entry reader UI to render navigation controls (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Add previous/next controls that link to `/entries/:id` and preserve the reader layout\n  - [x] Disable or visually indicate unavailable direction at bounds\n  - [x] Keep typography, spacing, and palette consistent with the reader layout (Fraunces + Source Serif 4, warm palette)\n- [x] Confirm navigation behavior stays in the single-page reader experience (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Use App Router route transitions only; no separate pages or dialogs\n  - [x] Preserve reader layout and media-first hierarchy during navigation\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] API test: entry response includes correct prev/next metadata for a trip\n  - [x] Component test: navigation controls render and respect disabled bounds\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- This story adds entry-to-entry navigation inside the existing single-page reader from Story 3.1.\n- Maintain the immersive, media-first reading flow; navigation should feel lightweight and not disrupt the reading context.\n- UX expectations: clear directional cues, obvious disabled states at first/last entries, no new page chrome.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 goal: fast, media-first entry reading with clear navigation.\n- Story 3.1 already created the entry reader layout; reuse and extend it.\n- Story 3.3 will add trip overview; do not fold overview responsibilities into this story.\n- Do not alter the private creator entry detail route (`/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]`) or `EntryDetail` UI; navigation applies to the public reader only.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Base ordering for navigation is chronological by `createdAt` (oldest → newest).\n- Add navigation metadata to the public entry read response (recommended fields):\n  - `previousEntryId` and `nextEntryId`\n  - Optional: `previousEntryTitle`, `nextEntryTitle`, `previousEntryDate`, `nextEntryDate` if needed for UI labels\n- Use a single additional Prisma query to resolve adjacent entries; avoid N+1 patterns.\n- Keep entry read path public for shared viewing; do not add auth gating to `/entries/:id` that blocks viewers.\n- Preserve error shape `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Do not return adjacent entries from a different trip; adjacent resolution must be scoped to the current entry's `tripId`.\n\n### Security and Performance Guardrails\n- Public entry navigation must not expand access beyond the current trip or entry scope.\n- Enforce trip scoping at the query level (adjacent entries filtered by `tripId`).\n- Keep the adjacent lookup O(1) queries: a single query per direction with `createdAt` ordering.\n- If a composite index on `(tripId, createdAt)` exists, use it implicitly; do not add migrations in this story unless required.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; public entry view stays in `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- REST handlers stay under `src/app/api`.\n- Server-side data fetching; client components only for UI interactivity as needed.\n- Validation is server-side only (Zod).\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript.\n- Tailwind CSS styling; match existing palette and layout tokens.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 for DB access, Zod 4.2.1 for validation.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Explicitly Deferred)\n- No web research performed. Follow pinned versions in `_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n- Defer external version checks because this story is a UI + API contract change using existing stack components only.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 3.1)\n- `EntryReader` already implements media-first layout and body rendering; extend it rather than re-creating the reader.\n- Public entry view route already exists: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx` uses `/api/entries/[id]` and maps to `EntryReader`.\n- `EntryDetail` and trip-specific entry pages are separate and should remain unchanged.\n- Tests exist for entry reader and API shape; align new tests with current patterns in `tests/components/` and `tests/api/`.\n- No recorded review corrections from Story 3.1; treat existing reader as the baseline for UI/UX.\n\n### Recent Git History Signals\n- Recent commits focused on entry media handling and reader UI (Stories 2.6 and 2.8).\n- Reuse existing entry/media component patterns; avoid duplicating gallery or viewer logic.\n- Keep API response shapes consistent with current tests expecting `{ data, error }`.\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Entries include `id`, `tripId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `media[]`, and `text`.\n- Navigation metadata should be derived by `tripId` and `createdAt` ordering.\n- Do not change response wrapper or error format.\n- Suggested response extension:\n  - `navigation: { previousEntryId: string | null, nextEntryId: string | null, previousEntryTitle?: string, nextEntryTitle?: string, previousEntryDate?: string, nextEntryDate?: string }`\n\n### Edge Cases to Cover\n- Trip with a single entry: both directions disabled, `previousEntryId` and `nextEntryId` are null.\n- First entry in trip: previous disabled; last entry: next disabled.\n- Entries with missing title: fall back to date or \"Daily entry\" label.\n- Entry with no media: navigation still renders and does not depend on media presence.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry reader UI: `src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx` (extend with navigation controls).\n- Public reader route: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- API handler: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (extend response).\n- Tests: `tests/api/` and `tests/components/` only (no co-located tests).\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Reuse `EntryReader` and existing layout styles; do not create a second reader.\n- Avoid introducing new route trees; navigation should use existing `/entries/:id`.\n- Do not introduce new state management libraries or RTK Query.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Component tests under `tests/components/entries/`.\n- API tests under `tests/api/` and must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n- Test scenarios to include:\n  - API: returns correct prev/next IDs for middle entry; nulls for bounds.\n  - UI: navigation buttons render with correct hrefs and disabled states at bounds.\n  - UI: navigating updates content and keeps reader layout (snapshot or DOM assertions).\n\n### Regression Checklist\n- Entry reader layout remains media-first with existing typography and spacing.\n- `/entries/:id` stays public for shared viewing.\n- `/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]` flow remains creator-only and unchanged.\n- Entry list ordering and trip overview behavior remain unaffected.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not implement trip overview or timeline browsing UI here (Story 3.3).\n- Do not add sharing or role management features (Epic 4/5).\n- Do not change media upload, entry editing, or trip management flows.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n- Follow `kebab-case.tsx` file naming and `PascalCase` components.\n- Keep utilities in `src/utils/` and avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Done Criteria\n- ACs 1-3 pass, navigation metadata is returned by API, and UI controls render with correct disabled states.\n- API and component tests for navigation pass in `tests/`.\n\n### References\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.2: Entry Navigation]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Navigation Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- App Router only;

Given the fullscreen viewer is open, when I want to exit, then I can close it without using on-screen buttons (Escape key and tap/click anywhere to exit).\n+3. Given I start a slideshow, when the slideshow is running, then a horizontal progress bar is shown with one segment per image in the slideshow.\n+4.
