Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to select invitees from a themed selector and manage the invited list,\nso that inviting viewers is faster and mistakes are easy to undo.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own\n   **When** I open the invite selector\n   **Then** I can choose from all active viewers and creators\n   **And** already invited users are not shown in the selector\n2. **Given** I am viewing the invited users list\n   **When** I remove an invited user\n   **Then** the user is removed from the list\n   **And** they can no longer access the trip\n3. **Given** I am inviting a user\n   **When** I interact with the selector\n   **Then** the selector matches the application's custom share panel styling\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add eligible invitees API (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Add a creator-only endpoint to list eligible invitees (active viewers + creators)\n  - [ ] Exclude the trip owner and already invited users from the response\n  - [ ] Return consistent `{ data, error }` shape with ISO dates\n- [ ] Update invite API to accept selector choice (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Accept `userId` from the selector (keep email-based invites only if still needed)\n  - [ ] Allow inviting active creators and viewers\n  - [ ] Preserve idempotent behavior on repeated invites\n- [ ] Add removal API endpoint (AC: 2)\n  - [ ] Implement `DELETE /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` for trip owners\n  - [ ] Return `404` for missing invites and `403` for unauthorized access\n- [ ] Update trip detail share panel UI (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Replace email input with a themed custom select matching existing share panel styles\n  - [ ] Show invitee name + email in the selector\n  - [ ] Filter out already invited users from selector options\n  - [ ] Add remove actions in the invited users list with confirmable affordance\n- [ ] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests for eligible invitee list, invite by userId, and removal\n  - [ ] Component tests for selector filtering and invited-user removal\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Story 5.4 added viewer invites with email input and a list of invited viewers; this story upgrades that flow.\n- Creator-only gating and ownership checks should stay consistent with existing trip invite endpoints.\n- Existing access checks for invited viewers should remain unchanged after invite removal.\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: complete Phase 2 account + role management, including viewer access and contributor permissions.\n- Related stories: 5.4 Invite viewers to a trip; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips.\n- Business value: faster invite management with fewer errors and easier cleanup.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires TripAccess model and invite endpoints from Story 5.4.\n- Requires active users from Story 5.1 and role assignments from Story 5.3.\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse share panel layout and typography patterns in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Reuse API error formatting and Auth.js token gating used in `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`.\n- Reuse existing list item styling for invited viewers to keep the UI consistent.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` only; keep trip viewer endpoints together.\n- UI changes should remain in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/`.\n- Tests belong under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip share UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Invite API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Eligible invitees must include active users with `viewer` or `creator` roles.\n- The trip owner should never be included in the eligible invitee list.\n- The invite selector must exclude already invited users without relying on manual filtering by the user.\n- Invite removal must revoke access immediately for removed users.\n- Responses must keep `{ data, error }` format with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failure.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts` (extend) and a new removal endpoint.\n- Trip UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for eligible invitee listing, creator+viewer invites, and removal permissions.\n- Component tests for selector filtering and remove action.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n### File List\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to select invitees from a themed selector and manage the invited list,\nso that inviting viewers is faster and mistakes are easy to undo.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own\n   **When** I open the invite selector\n   **Then** I can choose from all active viewers and creators\n   **And** already invited users are not shown in the selector\n2. **Given** I am viewing the invited users list\n   **When** I remove an invited user\n   **Then** the user is removed from the list\n   **And** they can no longer access the trip\n3. **Given** I am inviting a user\n   **When** I interact with the selector\n   **Then** the selector matches the application's custom share panel styling\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add eligible invitees API (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a creator-only endpoint to list eligible invitees (active viewers + creators)\n  - [x] Exclude the trip owner and already invited users from the response\n  - [x] Return consistent `{ data, error }` shape with ISO dates\n- [x] Update invite API to accept selector choice (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Accept `userId` from the selector (keep email-based invites only if still needed)\n  - [x] Allow inviting active creators and viewers\n  - [x] Preserve idempotent behavior on repeated invites\n- [x] Add removal API endpoint (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Implement `DELETE /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` for trip owners\n  - [x] Return `404` for missing invites and `403` for unauthorized access\n- [x] Update trip detail share panel UI (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Replace email input with a themed custom select matching existing share panel styles\n  - [x] Show invitee name + email in the selector\n  - [x] Filter out already invited users from selector options\n  - [x] Add remove actions in the invited users list with confirmable affordance\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests for eligible invitee list, invite by userId, and removal\n  - [x] Component tests for selector filtering and invited-user removal\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Story 5.4 added viewer invites with email input and a list of invited viewers; this story upgrades that flow.\n- Creator-only gating and ownership checks should stay consistent with existing trip invite endpoints.\n- Existing access checks for invited viewers should remain unchanged after invite removal.\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: complete Phase 2 account + role management, including viewer access and contributor permissions.\n- Related stories: 5.4 Invite viewers to a trip; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips.\n- Business value: faster invite management with fewer errors and easier cleanup.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires TripAccess model and invite endpoints from Story 5.4.\n- Requires active users from Story 5.1 and role assignments from Story 5.3.\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse share panel layout and typography patterns in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Reuse API error formatting and Auth.js token gating used in `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`.\n- Reuse existing list item styling for invited viewers to keep the UI consistent.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` only; keep trip viewer endpoints together.\n- UI changes should remain in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/`.\n- Tests belong under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip share UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Invite API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Eligible invitees must include active users with `viewer` or `creator` roles.\n- The trip owner should never be included in the eligible invitee list.\n- The invite selector must exclude already invited users without relying on manual filtering by the user.\n- Invite removal must revoke access immediately for removed users.\n- Responses must keep `{ data, error }` format with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failure.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts` (extend) and a new removal endpoint.\n- Trip UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for eligible invitee listing, creator+viewer invites, and removal permissions.\n- Component tests for selector filtering and remove action.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - Implementation plan: add eligible invitees endpoint listing active creators/viewers, excluding owner + existing invites.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Implementation plan: accept `userId` on invites and allow creator/viewer roles.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Implementation plan: add removal endpoint for trip owner invites.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n"}}
