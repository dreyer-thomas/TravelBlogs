Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator or viewer,\nI want the app typography to use a clean sans-serif style,\nso that reading and navigation feel modern and crisp across the whole app.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I open any page in the app\n   **When** the UI renders\n   **Then** headings and body text use the new sans-serif typography system\n2. **Given** the UI uses a sans-serif system\n   **When** I view long-form entry text\n   **Then** text remains readable and consistent with established spacing and sizing\n3. **Given** I inspect the UI styles\n   **When** I check typography tokens or global styles\n   **Then** legacy serif font references are removed or replaced with the new sans-serif font family\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Define the new sans-serif font stack and loading strategy (AC: 1-3)\n  - [ ] Use `next/font` (Google) for a Segoe UI-like sans-serif (e.g., `Source Sans 3`)\n  - [ ] Add system fallbacks: `\"Segoe UI\", \"Calibri\", \"Arial\", sans-serif`\n  - [ ] Remove references to `Fraunces` and `Source Serif 4`\n- [ ] Update global typography tokens (AC: 1-3)\n  - [ ] Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to apply the new font class or CSS variable\n  - [ ] Update `tailwind.config`/`globals.css` to map `font-sans` to the new font\n  - [ ] Confirm headings and body text both use the sans-serif stack\n- [ ] Verify visual consistency across key views (AC: 1-2)\n  - [ ] Trips list, trip detail, entry reader, shared trip pages\n  - [ ] Ensure line-height and font sizes still meet readability targets\n- [ ] Update documentation references (AC: 3)\n  - [ ] Replace serif typography references in `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Keep App Router structure; apply typography in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/globals.css` only. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use `next/font` for font loading; avoid external CSS imports. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Maintain accessibility: body text remains 17-18px with readable line height. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Typography System]\n- Avoid regressions in shared trip views and entry reader layout; recent fixes targeted media gallery and clickability. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-2-regenerate-shareable-link.md]\n\n### Developer Context: Typography Change Scope\n\n- This is a global typography shift across all screens, not limited to entry pages.\n- The intent is a clean, modern sans-serif similar to Segoe UI, with web-safe fallbacks.\n- Do not change layout spacing or component structure unless required for readability.\n\n### Epic Context & Dependencies\n\n- Epic 1 focus: trip creation and management; this story introduces a cross-cutting UI polish change.\n- No functional dependencies, but ensure existing trip and entry flows remain intact.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Use a single sans-serif family for headings and body text.\n- Apply the font via `next/font` and a global CSS variable or Tailwind `fontFamily` token.\n- Remove legacy serif font references from code and UX docs.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; global styles in `src/app/globals.css`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use Tailwind CSS for typography tokens. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + Tailwind CSS. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- `next/font` for font loading (no external CSS). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Global layout: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n- Global styles: `src/app/globals.css`\n- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.ts` or `tailwind.config.js`\n- UX spec update: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- If visual tests rely on font tokens/classes, update snapshots or expectations.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, response formats, and test locations.\n\n### References\n\n- Typography system (serif currently specified). [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Typography System]\n- Frontend architecture and Tailwind usage. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- App Router and global style locations. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- User requested a sans-serif typography change similar to Segoe UI across the whole app.\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n### File List\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
