Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Lightweight creator sign-in (single account)\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (MVP + Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR0: Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) for trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nWarm, human-readable pairing optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Fraunces` (expressive, travel-journal feel)\n- Body: `Source Serif 4` (highly readable long-form)\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative;

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to generate a shareable link for a trip,\nso that I can invite others to view it without requiring an account.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I generate a shareable link  \n   **Then** I receive a unique, unguessable URL for that trip\n2. **Given** I copy the shareable link and open it  \n   **When** the trip loads  \n   **Then** I can view the trip without signing in\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add a share link data model and migration for per-trip tokens (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Create a singular Prisma model for the trip share link with tripId, token, createdAt\n  - [x] Enforce one active share link per trip (unique tripId + token)\n- [x] Create API support for generating a share link (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a protected POST endpoint under `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n  - [x] Generate a cryptographically random token and return a full share URL in `{ data, error }`\n- [x] Add a public share view route (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Add a read-only route under `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n  - [x] Add a public API route to resolve token → trip overview data\n- [x] Surface the share link in the trip UI (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a Share panel/button in trip detail to create or reveal the link\n  - [x] Show copyable share URL with clear helper text\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n  - Responses must be wrapped as `{ data, error }` with errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; shareable link access must remain public.\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n  - Share links must be unguessable; use cryptographically random tokens (at least 32 bytes) and base64url encode.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (new), `src/app/api/trips/[id]/overview/route.ts` (reference).\n  - UI: `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx` (new), `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share control), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`.\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (new model + migration).\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (allow public share route).\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\n\n### Developer Context: Share Link Flow\n\n- Creator generates link from trip detail (authenticated).\n- Server creates or returns the existing share token for the trip.\n- Public visitor opens `/trips/share/[token]` and receives a read-only trip overview.\n- Public view must not require sign-in and must not expose trip edit actions.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Data model\n  - Add `TripShareLink` model with fields: `id`, `tripId`, `token`, `createdAt`.\n  - Enforce one active share link per trip (unique `tripId`).\n  - Token must be unique (unique `token`).\n- Creator API\n  - `POST /api/trips/[id]/share-link` requires creator auth.\n  - If a share link exists for the trip, return it; otherwise create one.\n  - Response: `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }`.\n- Public API\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` (or similar) does not require auth.\n  - Resolve token to trip + entries for read-only view.\n  - Return 404 for invalid token; do not leak whether a trip exists.\n- UI\n  - Trip detail page shows a Share action.\n  - If link exists, show it with copy-to-clipboard.\n  - If not, allow creator to generate it.\n  - Public share page uses the same Trip Overview UI pattern (latest entries first).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; new public share page lives under `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n- Use `next-auth/jwt` for creator endpoints; no auth for public share route.\n- Keep data access through Prisma; do not bypass models.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Use `crypto` from Node.js for token generation (`crypto.randomBytes`).\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }`.\n- Use Next.js Image for cover images and media thumbnails.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes:\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` for creator link generation.\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts` for public resolution.\n- UI routes:\n  - `src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx` for public trip view.\n- Components:\n  - Add any new share UI under `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add tests in `tests/api` for:\n  - creator share link creation (auth required).\n  - public share resolution (no auth).\n  - invalid token returns 404 with `{ data: null, error }`.\n- Add a UI test in `tests/components` for Share panel (render link + copy).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - API routes under `src/app/api`.\n  - New share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - Current middleware blocks all `/trips/*` paths; must allow `/trips/share/[token]` explicitly.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Epic 4: Simple Sharing]\n- Shareable links must be unguessable; public viewing requires no sign-in. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 4.1: Create Shareable Trip Link]\n- Architecture constraints: App Router, REST API patterns, auth, Prisma, error format. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Core Architectural Decisions]\n- Global agent rules for API response format, naming, tests, and routes. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: review\n- Completion note: Shareable link flow implemented with API, public view, UI, and tests passing.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- N/A\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Add TripShareLink Prisma model with one-to-one relation to Trip and unique tripId/token constraints.\n- Create migration for TripShareLink table and unique indexes.\n- Add model-level tests covering creation and uniqueness enforcement.\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Added TripShareLink model and migration; enforced unique tripId/token; added model tests; updated entry delete test data for required title.\n- Added share link POST API with auth and ownership checks plus tests for creation, reuse, and access control.\n- Added public share API + page rendering trip overview without entry links; added public share token tests.\n- Added share link panel in trip detail with copy action and UI test coverage.\n- Added share link lookup, proxy-safe share URL generation, and token collision retries with test coverage.\n- Suppressed default \"Entry photo\" captions in media gallery for shared entry views.\n- Added fullscreen viewer and slideshow controls to shared entry reader via media gallery interactions.\n\n### File List\n\n- travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma\n- travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251229120000_add_trip_share_link/migration.sql\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/trip-share-link-model.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/share-link.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/delete-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-overview.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/share-trip-overview.test.ts\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/media/media-gallery.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/entry-reader.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/media-gallery.test.tsx\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-1-create-shareable-trip-link.md\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-29: Implemented share link API, public view, and trip UI share panel with tests.\n- 2025-12-29: Hid default \"Entry photo\" captions in the media gallery.\n- 2025-12-29: Enabled fullscreen viewer + slideshow on shared entry reader.\n- 2025-12-29: Fixed share link lookup, proxy-safe URLs, collision retries, and shared overview entry links.\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\\n\\n## Story\\n\\nAs a creator,\\nI want to regenerate a trip's shareable link,\\nso that I can invalidate an old link if it was shared too broadly.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \\n   **When** I regenerate the shareable link  \\n   **Then** a new unique, unguessable URL is created  \\n   **And** the previous link no longer grants access\\n2. **Given** I open the new shareable link  \\n   **When** the trip loads  \\n   **Then** I can view the trip without signing in\\n3. **Given** I open the previous shareable link after regeneration  \\n   **When** the trip is requested  \\n   **Then** I see an access denied or not found message\\n\\n## Tasks / Subtasks\\n\\n- [ ] Add API support to regenerate an existing share link (AC: 1, 3)\\n  - [ ] Decide on route shape (e.g., `POST /api/trips/[id]/share-link/regenerate` or `PATCH /api/trips/[id]/share-link`) and keep REST plural\\n  - [ ] Require creator auth and trip ownership checks (reuse existing share-link auth pattern)\\n  - [ ] Rotate token with `crypto.randomBytes`, update `TripShareLink` record, update `createdAt`\\n  - [ ] Return `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }` with ISO date strings if included\\n- [ ] Update share link UI to allow regeneration (AC: 1)\\n  - [ ] Add a \\\"Regenerate link\\\" action in share panel with confirmation\\n  - [ ] Replace displayed link and copy-to-clipboard state after regeneration\\n- [ ] Ensure old links are invalidated (AC: 1, 3)\\n  - [ ] Public share resolver must fail for the old token (404 or access denied)\\n  - [ ] Add regression coverage to ensure old token no longer resolves\\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1-3)\\n  - [ ] API test: regenerate link rotates token and returns new URL\\n  - [ ] API test: old token returns 404/denied on public share route\\n  - [ ] UI test: share panel shows regeneration state + new link\\n\\n## Dev Notes\\n\\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\\n  - Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; public share access stays unauthenticated.\\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\\n- Source tree components to touch\\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (extend or add regenerate route)\\n  - API (public): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts` (ensure invalid old token fails)\\n  - UI: `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share panel), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`\\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (TripShareLink already exists)\\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (share route already allowed; avoid regressions)\\n- Testing standards summary\\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\\n\\n### Developer Context: Share Link Rotation Flow\\n\\n- Creator requests regeneration from trip detail (authenticated).\\n- Server rotates token on the single `TripShareLink` row for the trip.\\n- Old token must no longer resolve; public route returns 404/denied.\\n- New token resolves to the same public trip overview (read-only).\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- Data model\\n  - Reuse `TripShareLink` with unique `tripId` and `token`.\\n  - Regeneration updates `token` and `createdAt` (or add `updatedAt` if present).\\n- Creator API\\n  - Endpoint must require creator auth + ownership.\\n  - If no share link exists, either create then rotate, or return a clear error (align with UI behavior).\\n  - Response: `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }`.\\n- Public API\\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` must return 404/denied for revoked tokens.\\n  - Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid.\\n- UI\\n  - Confirm before regeneration (destructive action).\\n  - Update the displayed link and copy state immediately after success.\\n  - Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI.\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\\n- Use Prisma for persistence; no direct DB access bypass.\\n- Keep public share routes unauthenticated.\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Use Node `crypto.randomBytes` for token generation.\\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }`.\\n- Use Next.js Image for media thumbnails in shared views.\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- API routes under `src/app/api`:\\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` or `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/regenerate/route.ts`\\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\\n- UI components under `src/components/trips/`.\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- Tests in `tests/api`:\\n  - Regenerate rotates token and returns new URL.\\n  - Old token resolves to 404/denied.\\n- Tests in `tests/components`:\\n  - Share panel shows regenerate action and updates displayed URL.\\n\\n### Project Structure Notes\\n\\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\\n  - API routes under `src/app/api`.\\n  - New share UI under `src/components/trips`.\\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\\n  - None expected; reuse existing share link flow and public share route.\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Story 4.1 already introduced `TripShareLink` and the public share page.\\n- Share link generation uses `crypto.randomBytes` and returns a full share URL.\\n- Middleware explicitly allows `/trips/share/[token]` to remain public.\\n- Recent bugs fixed in shared view: ensure entry media/gallery and clickability remain intact.\\n\\n### Git Intelligence Summary\\n\\n- Recent commits touched shared trip view (`src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`) and entry reader/media gallery.\\n- Share link flow and public share API/tests already exist and follow response wrapper conventions.\\n- Regression risk: changes to share panel or share page should avoid breaking media gallery behavior or click targets.\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n\\n- No external web research completed (network access not enabled). If needed, confirm library changes for Auth.js, Prisma, or Next.js before implementation.\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n\\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Epic 4: Simple Sharing]\\n- Shareable links must be unguessable; public viewing requires no sign-in.

Your mission is to **thoroughly review** a story file that was generated by the create-story workflow and **systematically identify any mistakes, omissions, or disasters** that the original LLM missed.\n\n**Your purpose is NOT just to validate - it's to FIX and PREVENT LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n### **🚨 CRITICAL MISTAKES TO PREVENT:**\n\n- **Reinventing wheels** - Creating duplicate functionality instead of reusing existing\n- **Wrong libraries** - Using incorrect frameworks, versions, or dependencies\n- **Wrong file locations** - Violating project structure and organization\n- **Breaking regressions** - Implementing changes that break existing functionality\n- **Ignoring UX** - Not following user experience design requirements\n- **Vague implementations** - Creating unclear, ambiguous implementations\n- **Lying about completion** - Implementing incorrectly or incompletely\n- **Not learning from past work** - Ignoring previous story learnings and patterns\n\n### **🚨 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:**\n\nYou must thoroughly analyze **ALL artifacts** to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important quality control function in the entire development process!\n\n### **🔬 UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS:**\n\nUse research subagents, subprocesses, or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts **simultaneously and thoroughly**. Leave no stone unturned!\n\n### **🎯 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE:**\n\nThis is a COMPETITION to create the **ULTIMATE story context** that makes LLM developer mistakes **IMPOSSIBLE**!\n\n## **🚀 HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST**\n\n### **When Running from Create-Story Workflow:**\n\n- The `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml` framework will automatically:\n  - Load this checklist file\n  - Load the newly created story file (`{story_file_path}`)\n  - Load workflow variables from `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml`\n  - Execute the validation process\n\n### **When Running in Fresh Context:**\n\n- User should provide the story file path being reviewed\n- Load the story file directly\n- Load the corresponding workflow.yaml for variable context\n- Proceed with systematic analysis\n\n### **Required Inputs:**\n\n- **Story file**: The story file to review and improve\n- **Workflow variables**: From workflow.yaml (story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, etc.)\n- **Source documents**: Epics, architecture, etc. (discovered or provided)\n- **Validation framework**: `validate-workflow.xml` (handles checklist execution)\n\n---\n\n## **🔬 SYSTEMATIC RE-ANALYSIS APPROACH**\n\nYou will systematically re-do the entire story creation process, but with a critical eye for what the original LLM might have missed:\n\n### **Step 1: Load and Understand the Target**\n\n1. **Load the workflow configuration**: `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml` for variable inclusion\n2. **Load the story file**: `{story_file_path}` (provided by user or discovered)\n3. **Load validation framework**: `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml`\n4. **Extract metadata**: epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title from story file\n5. **Resolve all workflow variables**: story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, architecture_file, etc.\n6. **Understand current status**: What story implementation guidance is currently provided?\n\n**Note:** If running in fresh context, user should provide the story file path being reviewed. If running from create-story workflow, the validation framework will automatically discover the checklist and story file.\n\n### **Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis**\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Treat this like YOU are creating the story from scratch to PREVENT DISASTERS!**\n**Discover everything the original LLM missed that could cause developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n#### **2.1 Epics and Stories Analysis**\n\n- Load `{epics_file}` (or sharded equivalents)\n- Extract **COMPLETE Epic {{epic_num}} context**:\n  - Epic objectives and business value\n  - ALL stories in this epic (for cross-story context)\n  - Our specific story's requirements, acceptance criteria\n  - Technical requirements and constraints\n  - Cross-story dependencies and prerequisites\n\n#### **2.2 Architecture Deep-Dive**\n\n- Load `{architecture_file}` (single or sharded)\n- **Systematically scan for ANYTHING relevant to this story:**\n  - Technical stack with versions (languages, frameworks, libraries)\n  - Code structure and organization patterns\n  - API design patterns and contracts\n  - Database schemas and relationships\n  - Security requirements and patterns\n  - Performance requirements and optimization strategies\n  - Testing standards and frameworks\n  - Deployment and environment patterns\n  - Integration patterns and external services\n\n#### **2.3 Previous Story Intelligence (if applicable)**\n\n- If `story_num > 1`, load the previous story file\n- Extract **actionable intelligence**:\n  - Dev notes and learnings\n  - Review feedback and corrections needed\n  - Files created/modified and their patterns\n  - Testing approaches that worked/didn't work\n  - Problems encountered and solutions found\n  - Code patterns and conventions established\n\n#### **2.4 Git History Analysis (if available)**\n\n- Analyze recent commits for patterns:\n  - Files created/modified in previous work\n  - Code patterns and conventions used\n  - Library dependencies added/changed\n  - Architecture decisions implemented\n  - Testing approaches used\n\n#### **2.5 Latest Technical Research**\n\n- Identify any libraries/frameworks mentioned\n- Research latest versions and critical information:\n  - Breaking changes or security updates\n  - Performance improvements or deprecations\n  - Best practices for current versions\n\n### **Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis**\n\n**🚨 CRITICAL: Identify every mistake the original LLM missed that could cause DISASTERS!**\n\n#### **3.1 Reinvention Prevention Gaps**\n\n- **Wheel reinvention:** Areas where developer might create duplicate functionality\n- **Code reuse opportunities** not identified that could prevent redundant work\n- **Existing solutions** not mentioned that developer should extend instead of replace\n\n#### **3.2 Technical Specification DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong libraries/frameworks:** Missing version requirements that could cause compatibility issues\n- **API contract violations:** Missing endpoint specifications that could break integrations\n- **Database schema conflicts:** Missing requirements that could corrupt data\n- **Security vulnerabilities:** Missing security requirements that could expose the system\n- **Performance disasters:** Missing requirements that could cause system failures\n\n#### **3.3 File Structure DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong file locations:** Missing organization requirements that could break build processes\n- **Coding standard violations:** Missing conventions that could create inconsistent codebase\n- **Integration pattern breaks:** Missing data flow requirements that could cause system failures\n- **Deployment failures:** Missing environment requirements that could prevent deployment\n\n#### **3.4 Regression DISASTERS**\n\n- **Breaking changes:** Missing requirements that could break existing functionality\n- **Test failures:** Missing test requirements that could allow bugs to reach production\n- **UX violations:** Missing user experience requirements that could ruin the product\n- **Learning failures:** Missing previous story context that could repeat same mistakes\n\n#### **3.5 Implementation DISASTERS**\n\n- **Vague implementations:** Missing details that could lead to incorrect or incomplete work\n- **Completion lies:** Missing acceptance criteria that could allow fake implementations\n- **Scope creep:** Missing boundaries that could cause unnecessary work\n- **Quality failures:** Missing quality requirements that could deliver broken features\n\n### **Step 4: LLM-Dev-Agent Optimization Analysis**\n\n**CRITICAL STEP: Optimize story context for LLM developer agent consumption**\n\n**Analyze current story for LLM optimization issues:**\n\n- **Verbosity problems:** Excessive detail that wastes tokens without adding value\n- **Ambiguity issues:** Vague instructions that could lead to multiple interpretations\n- **Context overload:** Too much information not directly relevant to implementation\n- **Missing critical signals:** Key requirements buried in verbose text\n- **Poor structure:** Information not organized for efficient LLM processing\n\n**Apply LLM Optimization Principles:**\n\n- **Clarity over verbosity:** Be precise and direct, eliminate fluff\n- **Actionable instructions:** Every sentence should guide implementation\n- **Scannable structure:** Use clear headings, bullet points, and emphasis\n- **Token efficiency:** Pack maximum information into minimum text\n- **Unambiguous language:** Clear requirements with no room for interpretation\n\n### **Step 5: Improvement Recommendations**\n\n**For each gap identified, provide specific, actionable improvements:**\n\n#### **5.1 Critical Misses (Must Fix)**\n\n- Missing essential technical requirements\n- Missing previous story context that could cause errors\n- Missing anti-pattern prevention that could lead to duplicate code\n- Missing security or performance requirements\n\n#### **5.2 Enhancement Opportunities (Should Add)**\n\n- Additional architectural guidance that would help developer\n- More detailed technical specifications\n- Better code reuse opportunities\n- Enhanced testing guidance\n\n#### **5.3 Optimization Suggestions (Nice to Have)**\n\n- Performance optimization hints\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n- Enhanced debugging or development tips\n\n#### **5.4 LLM Optimization Improvements**\n\n- Token-efficient phrasing of existing content\n- Clearer structure for LLM processing\n- More actionable and direct instructions\n- Reduced verbosity while maintaining completeness\n\n---\n\n## **🎯 COMPETITION SUCCESS METRICS**\n\n**You WIN against the original LLM if you identify:**\n\n### **Category 1: Critical Misses (Blockers)**\n\n- Essential technical requirements the developer needs but aren't provided\n- Previous story learnings that would prevent errors if ignored\n- Anti-pattern prevention that would prevent code duplication\n- Security or performance requirements that must be followed\n\n### **Category 2: Enhancement Opportunities**\n\n- Architecture guidance that would significantly help implementation\n- Technical specifications that would prevent wrong approaches\n- Code reuse opportunities the developer should know about\n- Testing guidance that would improve quality\n\n### **Category 3: Optimization Insights**\n\n- Performance or efficiency improvements\n- Development workflow optimizations\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n\n---\n\n## **📋 INTERACTIVE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS**\n\nAfter completing your systematic analysis, present your findings to the user interactively:\n\n### **Step 5: Present Improvement Suggestions**\n\n```\n🎯 **STORY CONTEXT QUALITY REVIEW COMPLETE**\n\n**Story:** {{story_key}} - {{story_title}}\n\nI found {{critical_count}} critical issues, {{enhancement_count}} enhancements, and {{optimization_count}} optimizations.\n\n## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)**\n\n{{list each critical issue with clear, actionable description}}\n\n## **⚡ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Should Add)**\n\n{{list each enhancement with clear benefit description}}\n\n## **✨ OPTIMIZATIONS (Nice to Have)**\n\n{{list each optimization with benefit description}}\n\n## **🤖 LLM OPTIMIZATION (Token Efficiency & Clarity)**\n\n{{list each LLM optimization that will improve dev agent performance:\n- Reduce verbosity while maintaining completeness\n- Improve structure for better LLM processing\n- Make instructions more actionable and direct\n- Enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity}}\n```\n\n### **Step 6: Interactive User Selection**\n\nAfter presenting the suggestions, ask the user:\n\n```\n**IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\nWhich improvements would you like me to apply to the story?\n\n**Select from the numbered list above, or choose:**\n- **all** - Apply all suggested improvements\n- **critical** - Apply only critical issues\n- **select** - I'll choose specific numbers\n- **none** - Keep story as-is\n- **details** - Show me more details about any suggestion\n\nYour choice:\n```\n\n### **Step 7: Apply Selected Improvements**\n\nWhen user accepts improvements:\n\n- **Load the story file**\n- **Apply accepted changes** (make them look natural, as if they were always there)\n- **DO NOT reference** the review process, original LLM, or that changes were \"added\" or \"enhanced\"\n- **Ensure clean, coherent final story** that reads as if it was created perfectly the first time\n\n### **Step 8: Confirmation**\n\nAfter applying changes:\n\n```\n✅ **STORY IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED**\n\nUpdated {{count}} sections in the story file.\n\nThe story now includes comprehensive developer guidance to prevent common implementation issues and ensure flawless execution.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the updated story\n2. Run `dev-story` for implementation\n```\n\n---\n\n## **💪 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE MINDSET**\n\n**Your goal:** Improve the story file with dev agent needed context that makes flawless implementation inevitable while being optimized for LLM developer agent consumption. Remember the dev agent will ONLY have this file to use.\n\n**Success Criteria:** The LLM developer agent that processes your improved story will have:\n\n- ✅ Clear technical requirements they must follow\n- ✅ Previous work context they can build upon\n- ✅ Anti-pattern prevention to avoid common mistakes\n- ✅ Comprehensive guidance for efficient implementation\n- ✅ **Optimized content structure** for maximum clarity and minimum token waste\n- ✅ **Actionable instructions** with no ambiguity or verbosity\n- ✅ **Efficient information density** - maximum guidance in minimum text\n\n**Every improvement should make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer to:**\n\n- Reinvent existing solutions\n- Use wrong approaches or libraries\n- Create duplicate functionality\n- Miss critical requirements\n- Make implementation errors\n\n**LLM Optimization Should Make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer agent to:**\n\n- Misinterpret requirements due to ambiguity\n- Waste tokens on verbose, non-actionable content\n- Struggle to find critical information buried in text\n- Get confused by poor structure or organization\n- Miss key implementation signals due to inefficient communication\n\n**Go create the ultimate developer implementation guide! 🚀**\n"}}

API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n    48\t  - Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n    49\t  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; public share access stays unauthenticated.\n    50\t  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n    51\t  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n    52\t- Source tree components to touch\n    53\t  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (extend or add regenerate route)\n    54\t  - API (public): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts` (ensure invalid old token fails)\n    55\t  - UI: `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share panel), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`\n    56\t  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (TripShareLink already exists)\n    57\t  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (share route already allowed; avoid regressions)\n    58\t- Testing standards summary\n    59\t  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n    60\t  - Use API error format in expectations.\n    61\t\n    62\t### Developer Context: Share Link Rotation Flow\n    63\t\n    64\t- Creator requests regeneration from trip detail (authenticated).\n    65\t- Server rotates token on the single `TripShareLink` row for the trip.\n    66\t- Old token must no longer resolve; public route returns 404/denied.\n    67\t- New token resolves to the same public trip overview (read-only).\n    68\t\n    69\t### Technical Requirements\n    70\t\n    71\t- Data model\n    72\t  - Reuse `TripShareLink` with unique `tripId` and `token`.\n    73\t  - Regeneration updates `token` and `createdAt` (or add `updatedAt` if present).\n    74\t- Creator API\n    75\t  - Endpoint must require creator auth + ownership.\n    76\t  - If no share link exists, either create then rotate, or return a clear error (align with UI behavior).\n    77\t  - Response: `{ data: { shareUrl, token, tripId }, error: null }`.\n    78\t- Public API\n    79\t  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` must return 404/denied for revoked tokens.\n    80\t  - Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid.\n    81\t- UI\n    82\t  - Confirm before regeneration (destructive action).\n    83\t  - Update the displayed link and copy state immediately after success.\n    84\t  - Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI.\n    85\t\n    86\t### Architecture Compliance\n    87\t\n    88\t- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n    89\t- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n    90\t- Use Prisma for persistence; no direct DB access bypass.\n    91\t- Keep public share routes unauthenticated.\n    92\t\n    93\t### Library/Framework Requirements\n    94\t\n    95\t- Use Node `crypto.randomBytes` for token generation.\n    96\t- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }`.\n    97\t- Use Next.js Image for media thumbnails in shared views.\n    98\t\n    99\t### File Structure Requirements\n   100\t\n   101\t- API routes under `src/app/api`:\n   102\t  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` or `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/regenerate/route.ts`\n   103\t  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n   104\t- UI components under `src/components/trips/`.\n   105\t\n   106\t### Testing Requirements\n   107\t\n   108\t- Tests in `tests/api`:\n   109\t  - Regenerate rotates token and returns new URL.\n   110\t  - Old token resolves to 404/denied.\n   111\t- Tests in `tests/components`:\n   112\t  - Share panel shows regenerate action and updates displayed URL.\n   113\t\n   114\t### Project Structure Notes\n   115\t\n   116\t- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n   117\t  - API routes under `src/app/api`.\n   118\t  - New share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n   119\t- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n   120\t  - None expected; reuse existing share link flow and public share route.\n   121\t\n   122\t### Previous Story Intelligence\n   123\t\n   124\t- Story 4.1 already introduced `TripShareLink` and the public share page.\n   125\t- Share link generation uses `crypto.randomBytes` and returns a full share URL.\n   126\t- Middleware explicitly allows `/trips/share/[token]` to remain public.\n   127\t- Recent bugs fixed in shared view: ensure entry media/gallery and clickability remain intact.\n   128\t\n   129\t### Git Intelligence Summary\n   130\t\n   131\t- Recent commits touched shared trip view (`src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`) and entry reader/media gallery.\n   132\t- Share link flow and public share API/tests already exist and follow response wrapper conventions.\n   133\t- Regression risk: changes to share panel or share page should avoid breaking media gallery behavior or click targets.\n   134\t\n   135\t### Latest Tech Information\n   136\t\n   137\t- No external web research completed (network access not enabled). If needed, confirm library changes for Auth.js, Prisma, or Next.js before implementation.\n   138\t\n   139\t### Project Context Reference\n   140\t\n   141\t- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n   142\t- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n   143\t- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n   144\t- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n   145\t\n   146\t### References\n   147\t\n   148\t- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria.
