Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want revoked share links to invalidate all shared pages immediately,\nSo that old links never grant access after revocation or replacement.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I revoke a trip share link\n   **When** I open the old share link to the trip overview\n   **Then** I see not found or access denied\n2. **Given** I revoke a trip share link\n   **When** I open a shared entry page using the old token\n   **Then** I see not found or access denied\n3. **Given** I revoke and then generate a new share link\n   **When** I open the old share link or any old shared entry page\n   **Then** access is denied and no data is returned\n4. **Given** I open a valid share link\n   **When** I navigate between overview and entry pages\n   **Then** access remains valid for that token only\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Audit share token validation across overview and entry pages (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Verify overview route enforces token validation on every request\n  - [ ] Verify shared entry route enforces token validation on every request\n- [ ] Ensure revoked tokens are denied everywhere (AC: 1-3)\n  - [ ] Confirm server responses return 404/denied for old tokens\n  - [ ] Ensure client-side navigation cannot bypass token checks\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Add/extend API tests to cover revoked token access for overview and entry endpoints\n  - [ ] Add/extend UI or integration tests to confirm old shared entry pages are denied\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - Public share routes are unauthenticated and must not leak trip existence on invalid tokens.\n  - API responses must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use App Router; public share routes live under `src/app/trips/share/[token]`.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n  - API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]/route.ts`\n  - UI: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n  - UI: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`\n  - Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/share-trip-overview.test.ts`\n  - Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/share-trip-entry.test.ts`\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live in `travelblogs/tests` (no colocated tests).\n  - Invalid token should return 404/denied without leaking trip existence.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - Public share APIs remain in `src/app/api/trips/share/...`.\n  - Tests remain under `tests/api/` and `tests/components/`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - None expected; change is enforcement and test coverage.\n\n### References\n\n- Token invalidation bug from Epic 4 retrospective.

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

The functional flow is stable and well covered by tests. The remaining gaps are UI emphasis and a prior edge-case bug where old links still worked on a story page.\n\n## What Went Well\n- End-to-end share flow shipped (create, public view, revoke).\n- Strong API and UI test coverage for share access and invalid tokens.\n- Public share view aligned with read-only UX.\n\n## Challenges\n- Token invalidation edge case on story page (old link still worked after rotation/revocation).\n- Share controls felt too prominent in the trip UI.\n- Multiple surfaces touched for share flow (API, UI, middleware, tests), increasing regression risk.\n\n## Key Insights\n- Public share routes are a high-sensitivity area and need consistent invalidation rules across overview and entry views.\n- UI polish can lag functional completeness; keep them decoupled as separate follow-up work.\n\n## Action Items\n1. Fix share token invalidation on story page (old link must never work after regeneration/revoke)\n   - Owner: Amelia (Dev)\n   - Success: Old token returns 404 on all share routes and entry pages; regression test added\n\n2. Share UI refinement to be more discreet\n   - Owner: Sally (UX)\n   - Changes:\n     - Share control becomes a small icon/button in trip header (lower right beside Owner label)\n     - Revoke moves to Trip Actions area at the bottom\n     - Remove Regenerate action entirely (Revoke + Generate only)\n\n3. Mixed-access test coverage (public share vs authenticated roles)\n   - Owner: Murat (QA)\n   - Success: Test cases cover shared link access + signed-in role access with no regressions\n\n## Next Epic Preview (Epic 5)\nEpic 5 introduces authenticated multi-user roles (admin/creator/viewer) and trip-level permissions. The share foundation remains public and must stay isolated from authenticated role flows.\n\n## Preparation Notes\n- No critical prep work identified.\n- Parallel prep: maintain strict separation between public share routes and authenticated routes; expand mixed-access tests.\n- Nice-to-have: UI guidance to avoid share controls dominating trip detail UX.\n\n## Readiness Assessment\n- Testing & Quality: Acceptable; no concerns raised\n- Deployment: Live in production\n- Stakeholder Acceptance: Confirmed\n- Technical Health: Stable\n- Unresolved Blockers: None identified\n\n## Significant Discoveries\n- None that require changes to Epic 5 scope or assumptions.\n\n## Commitments\n- Complete action items before or during early Epic 5 work as noted above.\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to revoke a trip's shareable link,\nso that the trip is no longer accessible via that link.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own\n   **When** I revoke the shareable link\n   **Then** the link is disabled and no longer grants access\n2. **Given** I open a revoked link\n   **When** the trip is requested\n   **Then** I see an access denied or not found message\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Implement revoke API for a trip share link (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Choose REST shape under App Router (e.g., `DELETE /api/trips/[id]/share-link` or `PATCH /api/trips/[id]/share-link` with action)\n  - [x] Require creator auth + trip ownership checks (reuse existing share-link auth/ownership helpers)\n  - [x] Revoke by removing the `TripShareLink` record (preferred) or marking it revoked in a safe, queryable way\n  - [x] Return `{ data: { revoked: true, tripId }, error: null }` and keep ISO 8601 dates if included\n- [x] Ensure public share endpoints reject revoked links (AC: 2)\n  - [x] `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` returns 404/denied for revoked or missing token\n  - [x] `GET /api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]` also rejects revoked tokens\n  - [x] Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid\n- [x] Update share UI to allow revocation (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a destructive \"Revoke link\" action in the share panel with confirm modal\n  - [x] Clear displayed link state after revoke and show \"Link revoked\" status\n  - [x] Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1-2)\n  - [x] API test: revoke removes or invalidates token and returns expected response\n  - [x] API test: revoked token returns 404/denied on public share routes\n  - [x] UI test: share panel shows revoke action + updates state after revoke\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints.\n  - Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Use Auth.js JWT for creator-only endpoints; public share access stays unauthenticated.\n  - Use SQLite + Prisma 7.2.0; table names singular, columns camelCase.\n  - Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n  - Performance targets: public share resolve must keep entry switching under 1s and trip load 2-5s.\n  - Deployment constraints: no Docker or TLS proxy in MVP; `.env` + bare Node process on NAS only.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts` (extend with DELETE/PATCH revoke)\n  - API (public): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n  - API (public entries): `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]/route.ts`\n  - UI: `src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share panel), optional new component under `src/components/trips/`\n  - Data: `prisma/schema.prisma` (TripShareLink; no schema change required if deleting row)\n  - Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (keep share routes public; avoid regressions)\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live under `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n  - Use API error format in expectations.\n\n### Developer Context: Share Link Revocation Flow\n\n- Creator clicks \"Revoke link\" from trip detail share panel.\n- Server validates creator auth + ownership, revokes the `TripShareLink` row.\n- Public share routes must deny access for revoked or missing tokens.\n- UI should show revoked state and allow creating a new link via existing create/regenerate flow.\n\n### Epic Context & Dependencies\n\n- Epic 4 goal: frictionless sharing without accounts; revocation must not require sign-in for public share routes.\n- Depends on Story 4.1 (create share link) and Story 4.2 (regenerate link) for shared link model and UI patterns.\n- Reuse existing share link resolver and share panel instead of adding parallel flows.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Data model\n  - Prefer deleting `TripShareLink` to revoke; ensure Prisma delete is scoped by tripId and owner.\n  - If using a revoke flag instead, keep token unique and ensure public queries ignore revoked tokens.\n- Creator API\n  - Endpoint must require creator auth + ownership.\n  - Response: `{ data: { revoked: true, tripId }, error: null }`.\n- Public API\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]` must return 404/denied for revoked tokens.\n  - `GET /api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]` must also reject revoked tokens.\n  - Do not leak whether a trip exists when token is invalid.\n- UI\n  - Confirm before revoke (destructive action).\n  - Clear link display after revoke and show revoked state.\n  - Keep share panel layout consistent with existing trip detail UI.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints remain plural; keep error and response wrappers.\n- Use Prisma for persistence; no direct DB access bypass.\n- Keep public share routes unauthenticated.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Use Node `crypto.randomBytes` only if a new token is generated in the revoke flow (avoid unnecessary regeneration).\n- Use Next.js `fetch` in server components; handle `{ data, error }` wrapper.\n- Use Next.js Image for media thumbnails in shared views.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes under `src/app/api`:\n  - `src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/route.ts`\n  - `src/app/api/trips/share/[token]/entries/[entryId]/route.ts`\n- UI components under `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests in `tests/api`:\n  - Revoke removes or invalidates token and returns expected response.\n  - Revoked token returns 404/denied on public share routes.\n- Tests in `tests/components`:\n  - Share panel shows revoke action and updates display state.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - API routes under `src/app/api` and tests under `tests/`.\n  - Share UI under `src/components/trips`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - None expected; extend existing share link flow and public share routes.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.2 implemented share link regeneration with token rotation and updated public share guards.\n- Share link generation uses `crypto.randomBytes` and returns a full share URL.\n- Middleware explicitly allows `/trips/share/[token]` to remain public.\n- Recent fixes were made to shared trip view clickability and media gallery rendering; avoid regressions in shared views.\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits touched shared trip view (`src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`) and entry reader/media gallery.\n- Share link flow and public share API/tests already exist and follow response wrapper conventions.\n- Regression risk: changes to share panel or share page should avoid breaking media gallery behavior or click targets.\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- No external web research completed (network access not enabled). Use project-specified versions for Next.js, Prisma, Auth.js, Redux Toolkit, and Zod.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow API response wrapper and error format rules.\n- Keep table names singular and JSON keys camelCase.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no colocated tests).\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy for MVP work.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 4 story definition and acceptance criteria. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 4.3: Revoke Shareable Link]\n- Shareable links must be unguessable; public viewing requires no sign-in. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Epic 4: Simple Sharing]\n- Architecture constraints: App Router, REST API patterns, auth, Prisma, error format.

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want the share controls to be subtle and secondary in the trip UI,\nSo that sharing is available without dominating the trip experience.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I view a trip I own\n   **When** the trip header renders\n   **Then** the share control is shown as a small icon/button in the header near the Owner label\n2. **Given** I open trip actions\n   **When** I review destructive options\n   **Then** revoke share link is placed in the Trip Actions area\n3. **Given** the share UI is visible\n   **When** I look for link actions\n   **Then** there is no \"Regenerate\" action (Revoke + Generate only)\n4. **Given** no share link exists\n   **When** I use the share control\n   **Then** I can generate a new share link and copy it\n5. **Given** a share link exists\n   **When** I use the share control\n   **Then** I can view and copy the existing link without excessive UI emphasis\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Update trip header share control placement (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Move share trigger to a small icon/button near Owner label in the trip header\n  - [x] Ensure the control is visually subtle and does not dominate the header layout\n- [x] Adjust share actions layout (AC: 2, 3)\n  - [x] Move revoke action to the Trip Actions area at the bottom of the trip view\n  - [x] Remove regenerate action from the UI (API remains for Story 4.2)\n- [x] Keep share link generation and copy flow intact (AC: 4, 5)\n  - [x] Ensure generate + copy works from the discreet share control\n  - [x] Ensure existing link display and copy affordance remain clear but low-emphasis\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1-5)\n  - [x] Update share panel component tests for new placement and no regenerate action\n  - [x] Add/adjust UI tests to confirm revoke placement in Trip Actions area\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints\n  - App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n  - Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n  - Component files use `kebab-case.tsx` under `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Source tree components to touch\n  - UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx` (share control placement, revoke location)\n  - UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-overview.tsx` (if share trigger exists here)\n  - Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx`\n- Testing standards summary\n  - Tests live in `travelblogs/tests` (no colocated tests).\n  - Update existing component tests to match new layout and actions.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)\n  - UI components remain in `src/components/trips/`.\n  - Tests remain in `tests/components/`.\n- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)\n  - None expected; change is UI-only and should not alter API shape.\n\n### References\n\n- Share UI refinement action item from Epic 4 retrospective.
