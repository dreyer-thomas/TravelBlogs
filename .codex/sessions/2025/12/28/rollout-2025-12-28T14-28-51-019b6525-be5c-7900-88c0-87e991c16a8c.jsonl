Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to upload multiple media files for an entry in one action,\nso that I can add a full day's photos efficiently.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am creating or editing an entry  \n   **When** I select multiple media files to upload  \n   **Then** all selected files are attached to the entry  \n   **And** I see upload progress and completion states\n2. **Given** one or more files fail to upload  \n   **When** the upload completes  \n   **Then** I see which files failed  \n   **And** successfully uploaded files remain attached\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Define multi-file upload behavior and validation (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Allow multiple file selection in create/edit entry forms\n  - [ ] Validate file types and size per file; show per-file errors\n- [ ] Implement multi-file upload API handling (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Ensure `/api/media/upload` supports sequential or parallel uploads\n  - [ ] Capture failed uploads without blocking successful ones\n- [ ] Update entry media utilities for batch uploads (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Extend `uploadEntryMedia` to accept arrays or add `uploadEntryMediaBatch`\n  - [ ] Return success + failed file results for UI feedback\n- [ ] Enhance UI for progress and failure states (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Show per-file progress and completion states\n  - [ ] Surface failed files with retry/remove actions\n- [ ] Add tests for multi-file upload behavior (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Component test for multi-file selection and error display\n  - [ ] Utility tests for batch upload results handling\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Multi-file media upload supports attaching many photos to an entry in one action with progress and per-file error handling. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Media upload uses `/api/media/upload` and stores files on NAS; keep Next.js Image lazy loading for previews. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points] [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Validation is server-side only for entry save, but client should validate file type/size per file for better UX. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture] [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Form Patterns]\n- Maintain `{ data, error }` response wrapper in API responses. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Entry media utilities live in `src/utils/entry-media.ts` (extend for batch upload). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Create/edit entry forms live in `src/components/entries/`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Media upload API in `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Tests remain under `tests/` with `tests/components` and `tests/api` as needed.

[Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Show upload progress and completion states for each file. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- If some files fail, keep successful files attached and surface failures. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Preserve `{ data, error }` response wrapper for API interactions. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; REST routes live under `src/app/api`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for media previews and gallery. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation on entry save. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Media upload API: `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Media utilities: `src/utils/entry-media.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Entry forms: `src/components/entries/`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add component tests for multi-file selection, per-file error display, and retry handling. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Create entry form already supports multiple file selection but uploads sequentially and only returns a single error state; extend this to per-file status without breaking entry creation. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/create-entry-form.tsx]\n- Media upload uses `XMLHttpRequest` with progress callbacks; batch orchestration can wrap existing upload function. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/entry-media.ts]\n\n## Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits use utilities in `src/utils/entry-media.ts` for uploads and show previews via Next.js Image. Keep this pattern for multi-file updates. [Source: git log -5]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, API conventions, response format, and testing locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed; comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - None\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Story context generated from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context sources.\n - Included previous story and git intelligence to align multi-file upload with existing patterns.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-3-multi-file-media-upload.md\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/prd.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

[Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Entry media utilities live in `src/utils/entry-media.ts` (extend for batch upload). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Create/edit entry forms live in `src/components/entries/`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Media upload API in `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Tests remain under `tests/` with `tests/components` and `tests/api` as needed. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n### References\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3\n- _bmad-output/prd.md#Media Handling\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Form Patterns\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Allow selecting multiple media files in one action and attach all successful uploads to the entry. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Show upload progress and completion states for each file. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- If some files fail, keep successful files attached and surface failures. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Preserve `{ data, error }` response wrapper for API interactions. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; REST routes live under `src/app/api`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for media previews and gallery. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation on entry save. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Media upload API: `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Media utilities: `src/utils/entry-media.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Entry forms: `src/components/entries/`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add component tests for multi-file selection, per-file error display, and retry handling. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Create entry form already supports multiple file selection but uploads sequentially and only returns a single error state; extend this to per-file status without breaking entry creation. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/create-entry-form.tsx]\n- Media upload uses `XMLHttpRequest` with progress callbacks; batch orchestration can wrap existing upload function. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/entry-media.ts]\n\n## Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits use utilities in `src/utils/entry-media.ts` for uploads and show previews via Next.js Image. Keep this pattern for multi-file updates. [Source: git log -5]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, API conventions, response format, and testing locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed; comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - None\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Story context generated from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context sources.\n - Included previous story and git intelligence to align multi-file upload with existing patterns.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-3-multi-file-media-upload.md\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/prd.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n"}}
