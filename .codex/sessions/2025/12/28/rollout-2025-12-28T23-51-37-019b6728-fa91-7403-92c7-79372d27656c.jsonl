Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to see a trip overview with the latest entries first,\nso that I can quickly access the most recent updates.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I open a trip, when the trip overview loads, then I see the latest entries at the top in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest).\n2. Given the trip overview loads, then each entry shows its title, date, and a preview image.\n3. Given the trip has no entries, when I open the trip overview, then I see a clear empty state.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add a public trip overview API response for read-only viewing (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Create a public, unauthenticated read endpoint (new route) that returns trip metadata plus entry summaries for a trip\n  - [x] Ensure response follows `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` formats\n  - [x] Sort entries by `createdAt` descending (newest first) in the API or sort client-side consistently\n  - [x] Return minimal fields needed for overview: `id`, `tripId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `coverImageUrl`, `media[]` (if needed for fallback preview)\n- [x] Build trip overview UI for viewers (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Add a new public trip overview page (do not modify creator-only trip detail page)\n  - [x] Render trip header plus entry cards sorted newest-first with title, date, and preview image\n  - [x] Clicking an entry navigates to `/entries/:id` (public reader) without introducing new reader UI\n  - [x] Render a clear empty state if the trip has no entries\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] API test: overview returns newest-first ordering and includes required summary fields\n  - [x] Component test: overview renders entry cards with title/date/preview and empty state when no entries\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- This story introduces a public trip overview so viewers can scan the newest entries first and jump into the latest update quickly.\n- UX expectations: media-first previews, clean entry list, and a calm, readable overview that reinforces the Atlas Path direction.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 focus is fast entry reading with clear navigation; this overview should funnel users into the existing entry reader.\n- Story 3.1 provides the public entry reader (`/entries/[id]`); reuse it for navigation targets.\n- Story 3.2 added entry navigation; do not recreate navigation logic here.\n- Story 4 (shareable links) is not in scope; do not add link-generation or access controls beyond public read.\n\n### UX Requirements\n- Latest entry appears at the top of the overview list (reverse chronological order).\n- Each entry card shows title, date, and a preview image.\n- Empty state should be friendly, clear, and avoid dead-end UI.\n- Maintain typography (Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body) and warm palette from UX spec.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Keep the overview read-only and public (no auth required) to align with viewer access.\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for entry preview images.\n- Preview image selection priority:\n  1) `coverImageUrl` (if present),\n  2) first media URL,\n  3) first inline image from entry text (if already available in summary),\n  4) fallback placeholder.\n- Do not return full entry text for the overview unless required for preview extraction; prefer summary fields.\n\n### API Contract Notes\n- Introduce a public read endpoint separate from creator-only trip/entry APIs.\n- Response shape must be `{ data, error }` with errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Suggested response payload:\n  - `trip: { id, title, startDate, endDate, coverImageUrl }`\n  - `entries: [{ id, tripId, title, createdAt, coverImageUrl, media[] }]`\n\n### Performance & Accessibility Guardrails\n- Keep overview payload small; avoid heavy media lists if not needed for previews.\n- Ensure list layout is responsive and uses 44x44 touch targets for entry cards.\n- Provide clear focus states for keyboard navigation.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; new public overview page should be in `src/app/`.\n- REST endpoints are plural and live under `src/app/api`.\n- Use feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` only.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript.\n- Tailwind CSS styling; reuse existing tokens/palette.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 for data access; Zod 4.2.1 for validation if needed.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- New public overview page: `src/app/...` (create a new route; do not alter `src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx` creator view).\n- New UI component: `src/components/trips/` (e.g., `trip-overview.tsx` or `trip-overview-card.tsx`).\n- New public API route: `src/app/api/...` (separate from authenticated trip routes).\n- Tests: `tests/api/` and `tests/components/` only.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- API: verify response ordering (newest first) and required fields.\n- Components: verify entry cards render title/date/preview image and empty state displays.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 3.2)\n- Public entry reader exists at `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`; link overview cards to this route.\n- Preserve media-first reading flow; overview is a gateway, not a new reader.\n- Keep response shape and error format consistent with existing API tests.\n\n### Recent Git History Signals\n- Recent work focused on entry reader UI and media viewer patterns.\n- Reuse existing entry/media utilities (e.g., inline image extraction) instead of duplicating logic.\n- Keep styling consistent with entry reader and trip detail components.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Deferred)\n- No web research performed; use pinned versions from `_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Components `PascalCase`, files `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n- Use `next/image` with lazy loading for media.\n\n### References\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.3: Trip Overview with Latest Entries]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Core User Experience]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Component Strategy]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n- [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Add public overview API (read-only trip + entry summaries) with newest-first ordering.\n- Add public trip overview page and entry cards linking to `/entries/:id`.\n- Add API/component tests for ordering, summary fields, and empty state.\n- Guard public entry reads against non-creator-owned trips.\n- Add public overview page UI with entry cards and empty state.\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Added public trip overview API response with newest-first entry summaries.\n- Added API test covering overview ordering and required summary fields.\n- Guarded public entry reads against non-creator-owned trips to preserve access rules.\n- Added public trip overview page UI with newest-first entry cards and empty state.\n- Added component test for trip overview cards and empty state.\n- Tests: `npm test`.\n\n### File List\n\n- src/app/api/trips/[id]/overview/route.ts\n- src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- tests/api/trips/trip-overview.test.ts\n- src/app/trips/[tripId]/overview/page.tsx\n- src/components/trips/trip-overview.tsx\n- tests/components/trip-overview.test.tsx\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-29: Story 3.3 created.\n- 2025-12-28: Implemented public trip overview API and UI with tests.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: review\n"}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nWarm, human-readable pairing optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Fraunces` (expressive, travel-journal feel)\n- Body: `Source Serif 4` (highly readable long-form)\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative; CTA and title are focusable.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Keep latest entry preview under 2 lines.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap preview opens latest entry.\n\n### Timeline Entry Card\n\n**Purpose:** Enable fast scanning and navigation through the trip.  \n**Usage:** Timeline list and search results.  \n**Anatomy:** Thumbnail/media strip, title, date, location, short summary.  \n**States:** Default, hover, selected, unread/new.  \n**Variants:** Compact (list), rich (media-heavy).  \n**Accessibility:** Entire card is a link; ensure visible focus state.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Summary capped at 120 chars.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap to open entry detail.\n\n### Trip Switcher Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Switch between trips without confusion.  \n**Usage:** Global navigation.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip list with cover thumb, dates, last updated.  \n**States:** Default, selected, empty.  \n**Variants:** Drawer (mobile), popover (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation through list items.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting a trip returns to its latest entry.\n\n### Entry Reader\n\n**Purpose:** Long-form reading with immersive media.  \n**Usage:** Entry detail view.  \n**Anatomy:** Title, meta, media gallery, text body, map snippet.  \n**States:** Default, loading, error.  \n**Variants:** Read-only, contributor-editable.  \n**Accessibility:** Type size 17-18px minimum; skip-to-content.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Scrollable story, sticky top bar for navigation.\n\n### Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Keep spatial context while browsing entries.  \n**Usage:** Trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Map with pins + timeline list.  \n**States:** Default, selected pin, no location data.  \n**Variants:** Side-by-side (desktop), stacked (mobile).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard pin navigation; map has list alternative.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting pin highlights timeline entry.\n\n### Share/Invite Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Enable viewer access without friction.  \n**Usage:** Trip settings/share.  \n**Anatomy:** Share link, copy button, invite fields (optional).  \n**States:** Default, copied, error.  \n**Variants:** Minimal (link only), full (invite list).  \n**Accessibility:** Clear labels and focus feedback.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Copy link shows success state.\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Build custom components on top of design system tokens.\n- Keep core controls consistent with system defaults.\n- Prioritize accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation).\n- Use shared layout primitives for spacing consistency.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (Core Journeys):**\n- Active Trip Hero\n- Timeline Entry Card\n- Entry Reader\n\n**Phase 2 (Navigation + Context):**\n- Trip Switcher Panel\n- Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Phase 3 (Sharing):**\n- Share/Invite Panel\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**When to Use:** Primary for the single most important action; secondary for supportive actions; destructive only when necessary.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Primary: Teal filled buttons  \n- Secondary: Ghost style (text + subtle hover)  \n- Destructive: Clay red with clear label  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Only one primary action per view  \n- Destructive actions require confirm modal  \n**Accessibility:** Clear focus states and minimum 44px touch targets  \n**Mobile Considerations:** Primary action anchored near thumb-reach when possible\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Trip creation, entry creation/editing, sharing.  \n**Visual Design:** Labels above fields with asterisk for required fields.  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Inline validation as users type  \n- Errors appear below field with gentle, human language  \n- Submit disabled until required fields are valid  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Associate labels/inputs  \n- Error text announced by screen readers  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Large tap targets and clear spacing between inputs\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Global navigation, trip switching, entry browsing.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Desktop: Sidebar navigation with hamburger menu  \n- Mobile: Bottom button bar for primary sections  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Latest entry is visible on entry, but no persistent CTA  \n- Trips are always accessible via the nav  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Keyboard support for sidebar menu  \n- Clear active state indicator  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Bottom bar stays visible during scrolling\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop:** Map + timeline side-by-side for maximum context.\n- **Tablet:** Stacked layout (map above timeline) to keep reading simple.\n- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with bottom navigation for primary sections.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- **Mobile:** <768px  \n- **Tablet:** 768-1023px  \n- **Desktop:** 1024px+\n\nMobile-first layout with progressive enhancement for larger screens.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- Target **WCAG AA** compliance.\n- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.\n- Visible focus states for all interactive elements.\n- Minimum 44x44px touch targets.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Basic accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast checks.\n- Responsive device checks across mobile/tablet/desktop in major browsers.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary.\n- Support keyboard navigation for menus and drawers.\n- Keep line lengths and spacing optimized for readability.\n- Avoid hover-only interactions;

Given I am on the first or last entry, when I attempt to navigate past the bounds, then the unavailable direction is disabled or clearly indicated.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add navigation metadata to the public entry read flow (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Extend `GET /api/entries/[id]` to return adjacent entry IDs (and optional titles/dates) in chronological order\n  - [x] Ensure navigation respects the same trip ordering used in trip timelines (oldest → newest)\n  - [x] Keep `{ data, error }` response shape and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- [x] Update entry reader UI to render navigation controls (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Add previous/next controls that link to `/entries/:id` and preserve the reader layout\n  - [x] Disable or visually indicate unavailable direction at bounds\n  - [x] Keep typography, spacing, and palette consistent with the reader layout (Fraunces + Source Serif 4, warm palette)\n- [x] Confirm navigation behavior stays in the single-page reader experience (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Use App Router route transitions only; no separate pages or dialogs\n  - [x] Preserve reader layout and media-first hierarchy during navigation\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] API test: entry response includes correct prev/next metadata for a trip\n  - [x] Component test: navigation controls render and respect disabled bounds\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- This story adds entry-to-entry navigation inside the existing single-page reader from Story 3.1.\n- Maintain the immersive, media-first reading flow; navigation should feel lightweight and not disrupt the reading context.\n- UX expectations: clear directional cues, obvious disabled states at first/last entries, no new page chrome.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 goal: fast, media-first entry reading with clear navigation.\n- Story 3.1 already created the entry reader layout; reuse and extend it.\n- Story 3.3 will add trip overview; do not fold overview responsibilities into this story.\n- Do not alter the private creator entry detail route (`/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]`) or `EntryDetail` UI; navigation applies to the public reader only.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Base ordering for navigation is chronological by `createdAt` (oldest → newest).\n- Add navigation metadata to the public entry read response (recommended fields):\n  - `previousEntryId` and `nextEntryId`\n  - Optional: `previousEntryTitle`, `nextEntryTitle`, `previousEntryDate`, `nextEntryDate` if needed for UI labels\n- Use a single additional Prisma query to resolve adjacent entries; avoid N+1 patterns.\n- Keep entry read path public for shared viewing; do not add auth gating to `/entries/:id` that blocks viewers.\n- Preserve error shape `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Do not return adjacent entries from a different trip; adjacent resolution must be scoped to the current entry's `tripId`.\n\n### Security and Performance Guardrails\n- Public entry navigation must not expand access beyond the current trip or entry scope.\n- Enforce trip scoping at the query level (adjacent entries filtered by `tripId`).\n- Keep the adjacent lookup O(1) queries: a single query per direction with `createdAt` ordering.\n- If a composite index on `(tripId, createdAt)` exists, use it implicitly; do not add migrations in this story unless required.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; public entry view stays in `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- REST handlers stay under `src/app/api`.\n- Server-side data fetching; client components only for UI interactivity as needed.\n- Validation is server-side only (Zod).\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript.\n- Tailwind CSS styling; match existing palette and layout tokens.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 for DB access, Zod 4.2.1 for validation.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Explicitly Deferred)\n- No web research performed. Follow pinned versions in `_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n- Defer external version checks because this story is a UI + API contract change using existing stack components only.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 3.1)\n- `EntryReader` already implements media-first layout and body rendering; extend it rather than re-creating the reader.\n- Public entry view route already exists: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx` uses `/api/entries/[id]` and maps to `EntryReader`.\n- `EntryDetail` and trip-specific entry pages are separate and should remain unchanged.\n- Tests exist for entry reader and API shape; align new tests with current patterns in `tests/components/` and `tests/api/`.\n- No recorded review corrections from Story 3.1; treat existing reader as the baseline for UI/UX.\n\n### Recent Git History Signals\n- Recent commits focused on entry media handling and reader UI (Stories 2.6 and 2.8).\n- Reuse existing entry/media component patterns; avoid duplicating gallery or viewer logic.\n- Keep API response shapes consistent with current tests expecting `{ data, error }`.\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Entries include `id`, `tripId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `media[]`, and `text`.\n- Navigation metadata should be derived by `tripId` and `createdAt` ordering.\n- Do not change response wrapper or error format.\n- Suggested response extension:\n  - `navigation: { previousEntryId: string | null, nextEntryId: string | null, previousEntryTitle?: string, nextEntryTitle?: string, previousEntryDate?: string, nextEntryDate?: string }`\n\n### Edge Cases to Cover\n- Trip with a single entry: both directions disabled, `previousEntryId` and `nextEntryId` are null.\n- First entry in trip: previous disabled; last entry: next disabled.\n- Entries with missing title: fall back to date or \"Daily entry\" label.\n- Entry with no media: navigation still renders and does not depend on media presence.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry reader UI: `src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx` (extend with navigation controls).\n- Public reader route: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- API handler: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (extend response).\n- Tests: `tests/api/` and `tests/components/` only (no co-located tests).\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Reuse `EntryReader` and existing layout styles; do not create a second reader.\n- Avoid introducing new route trees; navigation should use existing `/entries/:id`.\n- Do not introduce new state management libraries or RTK Query.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Component tests under `tests/components/entries/`.\n- API tests under `tests/api/` and must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n- Test scenarios to include:\n  - API: returns correct prev/next IDs for middle entry; nulls for bounds.\n  - UI: navigation buttons render with correct hrefs and disabled states at bounds.\n  - UI: navigating updates content and keeps reader layout (snapshot or DOM assertions).\n\n### Regression Checklist\n- Entry reader layout remains media-first with existing typography and spacing.\n- `/entries/:id` stays public for shared viewing.\n- `/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]` flow remains creator-only and unchanged.\n- Entry list ordering and trip overview behavior remain unaffected.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not implement trip overview or timeline browsing UI here (Story 3.3).\n- Do not add sharing or role management features (Epic 4/5).\n- Do not change media upload, entry editing, or trip management flows.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n- Follow `kebab-case.tsx` file naming and `PascalCase` components.\n- Keep utilities in `src/utils/` and avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Done Criteria\n- ACs 1-3 pass, navigation metadata is returned by API, and UI controls render with correct disabled states.\n- API and component tests for navigation pass in `tests/`.\n\n### References\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.2: Entry Navigation]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Navigation Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- App Router only;

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \\\"## Skills\\\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"source\":\"cli\",\"model_provider\":\"openai\",\"git\":{\"commit_hash\":\"26335d782b33b75b5265232e7ad6ec800edef237\",\"branch\":\"main\"}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2025-12-28T21:46:34.530Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"# AGENTS.md instructions for /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\\n\\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\\n## Skills\\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \\\"## Skills\\\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2025-12-28T21:46:34.530Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<environment_context>\\n  <cwd>/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs</cwd>\\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\\n</environment_context>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2025-12-28T21:47:54.962Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"\\nYou must fully embody this agent's persona and follow all activation instructions exactly as specified.
