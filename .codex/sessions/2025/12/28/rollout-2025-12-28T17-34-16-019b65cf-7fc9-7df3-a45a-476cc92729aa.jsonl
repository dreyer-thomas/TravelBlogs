(Phase 2)\nFR2: Admin can assign a user role as creator or viewer. (Phase 2)\nFR3: System can authenticate users with email and password. (Phase 2)\nFR4: Creators can sign in and access their trips and entries. (Phase 2)\nFR5: Viewers can sign in and access trips they are allowed to view. (Phase 2)\nFR6: Creators can create trips. (Phase 1)\nFR7: Creators can edit trip metadata (name, dates, cover). (Phase 1)\nFR8: Creators can delete trips. (Phase 2)\nFR9: System can display a list of trips for a creator. (Phase 1)\nFR10: Creators can add a blog entry to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR11: Creators can edit a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR12: Creators can delete a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR13: Each entry can include a text body. (Phase 1)\nFR14: Each entry can include multiple media files. (Phase 1)\nFR15: System can display entries in a trip in chronological order. (Phase 1)\nFR16: Users can upload multiple media files in one entry. (Phase 1)\nFR17: System can display media-first entry pages. (Phase 1)\nFR18: System can show media in a gallery or carousel within an entry. (Phase 1)\nFR19: Creators can generate a shareable link to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR20: Anyone with the shareable link can view the trip. (Phase 1)\nFR21: Creators can invite specific users to a trip as viewers. (Phase 2)\nFR22: Creators can enable a viewer to contribute to a trip. (Phase 2)\nFR23: Viewers can view trips they are invited to. (Phase 2)\nFR24: Viewers with contribution enabled can add entries to that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR25: Viewers with contribution enabled can edit entries in that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR26: System can display a trip map view with entry locations. (Phase 3)\nFR27: System can display a timeline view tied to map locations. (Phase 3)\nFR28: System can extract coordinates from photo metadata. (Phase 3)\nFR29: Users can view a trip overview with latest entries. (Phase 1)\nFR30: Users can open an entry in a single-page view. (Phase 1)\nFR31: Users can navigate between entries in a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR32: Admin can manage user access and roles. (Phase 2)\nFR33: Admin can deactivate users. (Phase 2)\n\n### MVP Scope Adjustment\n\n- Lightweight authentication is required in MVP to protect creator trip/entry management.\n- This is a scope change from the PRD (which labels auth in Phase 2). Update the PRD when convenient.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Page load time is 5-10 seconds under typical home broadband.\nNFR2: Entry switching response time is under 1 second.\nNFR3: Trip switching response time is 2-5 seconds.\nNFR4: Media upload supports 10-15 files per entry under normal consumer bandwidth.\nNFR5: Use HTTPS for all traffic.\nNFR6: Store passwords using secure hashing when user management is introduced (Phase 2).\nNFR7: Shareable links are unguessable.\nNFR8: Support current versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.\nNFR9: Provide responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers.\nNFR10: Accessibility follows standard good practices (UX specifies WCAG AA).\nNFR11: SPA architecture with no multi-page app requirement.\nNFR12: No SEO requirement; app is private.\nNFR13: No real-time updates; viewers refresh to see new entries.\nNFR14: Optimize media loading and rendering to support fast entry switching.\nNFR15: Enforce role-based access on client and server.\nNFR16: Support small groups up to 15 viewers per trip.\nNFR17: Support low concurrency (2-3 concurrent viewers).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Starter: initialize with `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs` and select TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for styling.\n- Database: SQLite with Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast.\n- UX typography: Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body, body size 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars.\n- UX color tokens: warm terracotta primary, deep teal secondary, ivory/sand surfaces, charcoal text with defined semantic colors.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 5 - Admin creates users  \nFR2: Epic 5 - Role assignment  \nFR3: Epic 5 -

[Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Media upload uses `/api/media/upload` and stores files on NAS; keep Next.js Image lazy loading for previews. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points] [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Validation is server-side only for entry save, but client should validate file type/size per file for better UX. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture] [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Form Patterns]\n- Maintain `{ data, error }` response wrapper in API responses.

[Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Media upload API in `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Tests remain under `tests/` with `tests/components` and `tests/api` as needed.

[Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Show upload progress and completion states for each file. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- If some files fail, keep successful files attached and surface failures. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.3]\n- Preserve `{ data, error }` response wrapper for API interactions. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; REST routes live under `src/app/api`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for media previews and gallery. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation on entry save. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Media upload API: `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Media utilities: `src/utils/entry-media.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Entry forms: `src/components/entries/`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add component tests for multi-file selection, per-file error display, and retry handling. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Create entry form already supports multiple file selection but uploads sequentially and only returns a single error state; extend this to per-file status without breaking entry creation. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/create-entry-form.tsx]\n- Media upload uses `XMLHttpRequest` with progress callbacks; batch orchestration can wrap existing upload function. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/entry-media.ts]\n\n## Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits use utilities in `src/utils/entry-media.ts` for uploads and show previews via Next.js Image. Keep this pattern for multi-file updates. [Source: git log -5]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, API conventions, response format, and testing locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to review.\n- Note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed; comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-28: Completed multi-file upload behavior, API handling, UI status updates, and tests.\n- 2025-12-28: Addressed review fixes for upload previews and form cleanup; updated story file list.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - None\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Story context generated from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context sources.\n - Included previous story and git intelligence to align multi-file upload with existing patterns.\n - Plan: add per-file validation lists for entry media inputs and block submission when file errors exist.\n - Implemented per-file validation errors for inline and gallery uploads in create/edit forms.\n - Tests: updated `travelblogs/tests/components/create-entry-form.test.tsx`, `travelblogs/tests/components/edit-entry-form.test.tsx`; `npm test`.\n - Implemented multi-file handling in `/api/media/upload` with per-file uploads/failures response.\n - Tests: updated `travelblogs/tests/api/media/upload-cover-image.test.ts`; `npm test`.\n - Added `uploadEntryMediaBatch` to return uploads/failures and emit per-file progress.\n - Tests: added `travelblogs/tests/components/entry-media-utils.test.ts`; `npm test`.\n - Added per-file upload status lists (progress/success/failure) for entry media and inline uploads with retry/remove.\n - Tests: updated `travelblogs/tests/components/create-entry-form.test.tsx`, `travelblogs/tests/components/edit-entry-form.test.tsx`; `npm test`.\n - Tests: added multi-file status coverage in create/edit entry form component tests; updated `travelblogs/tests/components/entry-media-utils.test.ts`; `npm test`.\n - Review fixes: removed stale progress state calls and removed failed upload previews in create/edit entry forms.\n - Updated story File List to reflect actual changed files; excluded unrelated local tooling artifacts.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-3-multi-file-media-upload.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/new/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/create-entry-form.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/create-entry-form-wrapper.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/edit-entry-form.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/utils/entry-media.ts\n- travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma\n- travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251228140516_add_entry_title/\n- travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251228142333_add_entry_cover_image/\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/update-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/media/upload-cover-image.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/components/create-entry-form.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/edit-entry-form.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/entry-media-utils.test.ts\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to add a short title for each blog entry,\nso that the entry is summarized in one short message.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I am creating or editing an entry, when I enter a title up to 80 characters, then the title is saved with the entry and appears in the entry list and entry view header.\n2. Given I submit an entry without a title or with a title over 80 characters, when I attempt to save, then I see a clear validation error and the entry is not saved.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add entry title to data model and API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add `title` field to entry model in `prisma/schema.prisma` and run migration\n  - [x] Update entry create/update validation (Zod) to require `title` and enforce max length 80\n  - [x] Ensure API responses include `title` in entry payloads\n- [x] Update entry create/edit UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add title input to entry create/edit form with 80-char limit hint\n  - [x] Show validation errors for missing/too-long title\n- [x] Display title in entry list and entry view header (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Update entry list item to show title summary\n  - [x] Update entry reader header to show title\n- [x] Tests and regression checks (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add/extend API tests for required title and max length\n  - [x] Add/extend component tests for title rendering in list and entry view\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- Titles are short summaries that help scan entries in the list and orient readers in the entry view.\n- Keep title input lightweight and always required for entry create/edit flows.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Title is required; max length 80 characters.\n- Validation is server-side (Zod) with clear error messaging.\n- API response shape remains `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Validation is server-side only.\n- Use `camelCase` JSON fields; keep REST endpoints plural.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS styling.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation; Prisma 7.2.0 for schema/migrations.\n- Latest-version verification not performed; use pinned versions from architecture and project context.\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Update `entry` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` to include `title` (string, required).\n- Entry payloads must include `title` in list and detail responses.\n- Align field names and types with `prisma/schema.prisma`; do not invent fields.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry forms/components live in `src/components/entries/`.\n- API handlers under `src/app/api/entries/`.\n- Shared UI atoms in `src/components/ui/`.\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Reuse existing entry form components; do not create duplicate forms.\n- Keep data fetching in route handlers and server components; avoid API calls inside UI atoms.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- API tests in `tests/api/` must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n- Component tests (if present) in `tests/components/entries/`.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not change entry body/media behavior beyond adding title.\n- Do not change auth flows or permissions.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Aligns with structure: `src/app/api/entries/`, `src/components/entries/`, `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- Keep files `kebab-case.tsx`, components `PascalCase`.\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.5: Entry Title]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- npm test\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Added required entry titles in Prisma schema and API validation (80 char max) with payload coverage.\n- Updated entry create/edit forms with length hint and client-side validation for required titles.\n- Added component coverage for entry titles in list and entry detail header plus API validation tests.\n- Tests: `npm test`.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-5-entry-title.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma\n- travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251228160000_remove_entry_title_default/migration.sql\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/create-entry-form.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/edit-entry-form.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/update-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/list-entries.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/get-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/components/entry-detail.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trip-detail.test.tsx\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: review\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-28: Added required entry titles with 80-char limit across Prisma, API validation, UI, and tests.\n"}}
