Given I submit an entry without a title or with a title over 80 characters, when I attempt to save, then I see a clear validation error and the entry is not saved.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add entry title to data model and API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `title` field to entry model in `prisma/schema.prisma` and run migration\n  - [ ] Update entry create/update validation (Zod) to require `title` and enforce max length 80\n  - [ ] Ensure API responses include `title` in entry payloads\n- [ ] Update entry create/edit UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add title input to entry create/edit form with 80-char limit hint\n  - [ ] Show validation errors for missing/too-long title\n- [ ] Display title in entry list and entry view header (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Update entry list item to show title summary\n  - [ ] Update entry reader header to show title\n- [ ] Tests and regression checks (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add/extend API tests for required title and max length\n  - [ ] Add/extend component tests for title rendering in list and entry view\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- Titles are short summaries that help scan entries in the list and orient readers in the entry view.\n- Keep title input lightweight and always required for entry create/edit flows.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Title is required; max length 80 characters.\n- Validation is server-side (Zod) with clear error messaging.\n- API response shape remains `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Validation is server-side only.\n- Use `camelCase` JSON fields; keep REST endpoints plural.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS styling.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation; Prisma 7.2.0 for schema/migrations.\n- Latest-version verification not performed; use pinned versions from architecture and project context.\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Update `entry` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` to include `title` (string, required).\n- Entry payloads must include `title` in list and detail responses.\n- Align field names and types with `prisma/schema.prisma`; do not invent fields.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry forms/components live in `src/components/entries/`.\n- API handlers under `src/app/api/entries/`.\n- Shared UI atoms in `src/components/ui/`.\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Reuse existing entry form components; do not create duplicate forms.\n- Keep data fetching in route handlers and server components; avoid API calls inside UI atoms.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- API tests in `tests/api/` must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n- Component tests (if present) in `tests/components/entries/`.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not change entry body/media behavior beyond adding title.\n- Do not change auth flows or permissions.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Aligns with structure: `src/app/api/entries/`, `src/components/entries/`, `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- Keep files `kebab-case.tsx`, components `PascalCase`.\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.5: Entry Title]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n- TBD during implementation\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: ready-for-dev\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to add a short title for each blog entry,\nso that the entry is summarized in one short message.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I am creating or editing an entry, when I enter a title up to 80 characters, then the title is saved with the entry and appears in the entry list and entry view header.\n2. Given I submit an entry without a title or with a title over 80 characters, when I attempt to save, then I see a clear validation error and the entry is not saved.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add entry title to data model and API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `title` field to entry model in `prisma/schema.prisma` and run migration\n  - [ ] Update entry create/update validation (Zod) to require `title` and enforce max length 80\n  - [ ] Ensure API responses include `title` in entry payloads\n- [ ] Update entry create/edit UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add title input to entry create/edit form with 80-char limit hint\n  - [ ] Show validation errors for missing/too-long title\n- [ ] Display title in entry list and entry view header (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Update entry list item to show title summary\n  - [ ] Update entry reader header to show title\n- [ ] Tests and regression checks (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add/extend API tests for required title and max length\n  - [ ] Add/extend component tests for title rendering in list and entry view\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- Titles are short summaries that help scan entries in the list and orient readers in the entry view.\n- Keep title input lightweight and always required for entry create/edit flows.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Title is required; max length 80 characters.\n- Validation is server-side (Zod) with clear error messaging.\n- API response shape remains `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Validation is server-side only.\n- Use `camelCase` JSON fields; keep REST endpoints plural.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS styling.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation; Prisma 7.2.0 for schema/migrations.\n- Latest-version verification not performed; use pinned versions from architecture and project context.\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Update `entry` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` to include `title` (string, required).\n- Entry payloads must include `title` in list and detail responses.\n- Align field names and types with `prisma/schema.prisma`; do not invent fields.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry forms/components live in `src/components/entries/`.\n- API handlers under `src/app/api/entries/`.\n- Shared UI atoms in `src/components/ui/`.\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Reuse existing entry form components; do not create duplicate forms.\n- Keep data fetching in route handlers and server components; avoid API calls inside UI atoms.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- API tests in `tests/api/` must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n- Component tests (if present) in `tests/components/entries/`.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not change entry body/media behavior beyond adding title.\n- Do not change auth flows or permissions.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Aligns with structure: `src/app/api/entries/`, `src/components/entries/`, `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- Keep files `kebab-case.tsx`, components `PascalCase`.\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.5: Entry Title]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n- TBD during implementation\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: ready-for-dev\n"}}
