Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast.\n- UX typography: Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body, body size 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars.\n- UX color tokens: warm terracotta primary, deep teal secondary, ivory/sand

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want all entry images managed in one place,\nso that I can select the story image, insert inline photos, or remove images without re-uploading.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am creating or editing an entry  \n   **When** I upload images  \n   **Then** they appear in a single entry image library as the first step in the media flow\n2. **Given** I hover over an image in the library  \n   **When** I choose \"Set as story image\"  \n   **Then** that image becomes the story image selection\n3. **Given** I hover over an image in the library  \n   **When** I choose \"Insert inline\"  \n   **Then** an image link in the format `![Entry photo](<url>)` is inserted at the current cursor position in the entry text  \n   **And** if the image already has a custom alt in the entry text, it is preserved\n4. **Given** I hover over an image in the library  \n   **When** I choose \"Remove\"  \n   **Then** the image is removed from the entry media and no longer selectable for story or inline use  \n   **And** any inline references matching `![...](<url>)` are removed from the entry text\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Consolidate entry image upload into a single library UI (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Replace separate \"Story image\", \"Inline photos\", and \"Media files\" upload inputs with one upload input\n  - [ ] Display all uploaded images in a unified gallery/grid with hover actions\n- [ ] Add story image selection from library (AC: 2)\n  - [ ] Store the selected story image URL and show the current selection state in the library\n  - [ ] Ensure the selected image is saved with the entry as the story image\n- [ ] Add inline insert action at cursor (AC: 3)\n  - [ ] Track current cursor position in the entry text field\n  - [ ] Insert the selected image URL into the text at the cursor using the existing inline image format\n  - [ ] Preserve existing custom alt text when reinserting or updating inline images\n- [ ] Add remove action and cleanup behavior (AC: 4)\n  - [ ] Remove the image from the entry media list and library view\n  - [ ] If the image is the current story image, clear the selection\n  - [ ] If the image appears inline in the text, remove the inline reference\n- [ ] Update validations and UX copy (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Ensure at least one image exists between the library and inline text if required\n  - [ ] Replace helper text to reflect the unified image library flow\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Component tests for library actions (set story image, insert inline, remove)\n  - [ ] Utility tests for inline insertion and removal behavior\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Use the existing entry media upload and inline image utilities; unify the UI without changing the media upload API contract. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Inline insert should use `![Entry photo](<url>)` by default; if an image already has a custom alt in the text, preserve it. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/entry-content.ts]\n- Maintain `{ data, error }` response wrapper for API interactions. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Entry forms live in `src/components/entries/` and should remain the single source of truth for entry media selection. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Tests live under `tests/` only (no co-located tests). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Update `src/components/entries/create-entry-form.tsx` and `src/components/entries/edit-entry-form.tsx` for the unified library UI.\n- Inline image extraction and insertion helpers live in `src/utils/entry-content.ts`.\n- Media upload helpers live in `src/utils/entry-media.ts`.\n\n### References\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.6\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n### File List\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to open an entry in a single-page reader with a media-first layout,\nso that I can consume the day's story quickly.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I have access to a trip, when I open an entry, then I see the entry on a single page with media displayed prominently.\n2. Given I have access to a trip, when I open an entry, then the entry text is readable without navigating to another page.\n3. Given the entry includes multiple media files, when the entry loads, then media is displayed in the entry view in a gallery or carousel.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Build single-page entry reader layout (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Create/extend `EntryReader` component with media-first layout and readable body typography\n  - [ ] Implement media gallery/carousel UI for multiple files\n  - [ ] Ensure entry content renders in one page (no secondary routes)\n- [ ] Fetch and render entry data (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Load entry by `id` via App Router `page.tsx` (server component + `fetch`)\n  - [ ] Map API response into `EntryReader` props with `camelCase` fields\n- [ ] Accessibility and performance pass (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Ensure focus states, keyboard navigation, and 44x44 targets\n  - [ ] Use `next/image` with lazy loading; avoid layout shifts\n  - [ ] Verify entry switching stays under 1s in typical media sizes\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- Media-first, single-page reading experience; no navigation between entries in this story (that is Story 3.2).\n- Prioritize immersion and readability: large media presence, clear text flow, minimal chrome.\n- UX targets: body text 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars, Fraunces headings + Source Serif 4 body.\n- Accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus, 44x44 targets, strong contrast.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 goal: fast, media-first entry reading with clear navigation; this story covers the single-page reader only.\n- Depends on existing entry data and media upload flows from Epic 2 (entries/media must already exist).\n- Do not implement entry-to-entry navigation or trip overview here; those are Stories 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Entry data must render in a single App Router page without secondary navigation.\n- Media-first definition: first media item renders as full-width hero above the text; remaining media render in a horizontal carousel below the hero.\n- Use `next/image` with lazy loading for media, and avoid layout shift.\n- Error responses and UI must use `{ data, error }` response shape and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; entry view lives under `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- REST API read via `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` and `fetch`.\n- Use server components for data fetching; client components only if interactivity requires it.\n- Validation is server-side only (Zod).\n- Access control must be enforced server-side (viewer access via shareable link or authenticated role/ACL).\n- Deployment/Env: No special deployment steps required for this story; use existing `.env` conventions and App Router build defaults.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS styling.\n- Redux Toolkit patterns if client state needed (avoid RTK Query).\n- Zod for server validation if request params are validated.\n- Latest-version verification not performed; use pinned versions from architecture and project context.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Explicitly Deferred)\n- No web research performed in this story. Do not change library versions; follow pinned versions in `/_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `/_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Versioned Stack (Authoritative for This Story)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Expect entry to include: `id`, `tripId`, `title` (or date/title), `body`, `media[]`, `createdAt` (ISO 8601).\n- Media items should include at minimum: `id`, `url`, `type` (image/video), `width`, `height`, `alt` (if available).\n- API response must remain `{ data, error }`; on not found or unauthorized, return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }`.\n- Align field names and types with `prisma/schema.prisma`; do not invent fields not present in the schema.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry reader UI: `src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx`.\n- Media gallery UI: `src/components/media/media-gallery.tsx`.\n- Shared UI atoms in `src/components/ui/`.\n- Utilities in `src/utils/`; avoid creating new `lib/`.\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Do not create duplicate reader or gallery components; extend `EntryReader` and `media-gallery` if they exist.\n- Reuse shared UI atoms (buttons, modals) instead of new bespoke variants.\n- Avoid embedding API calls inside presentational components; keep data loading in `page.tsx`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- If component tests exist, add/extend `tests/components/entries/*`.\n- API tests (if added) go under `tests/api/` and must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not implement entry navigation, trip overview, map/timeline, or sharing UI in this story.\n- Do not add new auth flows; rely on existing access control at API level.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Aligns with defined structure: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/entries/`, `src/components/media/`.\n- No new structure conflicts anticipated; keep files `kebab-case.tsx`, components `PascalCase`.\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.1: View Entry (Single-Page Reader)]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Visual Design Foundation]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Components `PascalCase`, files `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n- Use `next/image` and lazy loading for media.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n- TBD during implementation\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: ready-for-dev\n"}}
