Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

This approach should simplify controlling timers without test timeouts while preserving reliable assertions."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpUYEtPzSGEmmFVx5F1owJhGYN6945K6Z4FjKR7f8rpA5lW6ZIKbbvXKToOQkMO3sHgqVP7MKZ0aApUU02OxJhmceAIWNLBNQFnyjJXHlHpfBzoBSnRYCOseUOumERFsqmowDg4WxhN-mtzTAFxlSBvCY3VjEbwc-96Um_prNJn9Rz072WvLIyZR0eTywezr7Sw_ca1jHWZZeAHbTHA4xrqTbnq2AF275QkEAiqn81l7OmpnoKbtoHbg1-iD6PT7_P9G-jTvKdI2C6Yby3yo2WeotMRo8BBpvbsHkQuC9uOz7UmJzjVaHA2hnVG_YIiwBFGgkAuedfq0LALjeyY15pQHYM6mKxV3WoAjie8tupVAjFVdzUOA11qUJXVEOy87VyAnzPouzJRIf0MlCUW_WBu299oIW7EDiZBrN9vqe4Ng2shNGEteOLLJDFC6CmQN29AvEt9dUKWqGHujv0owVmFbyQlAu45TEOCp-2seRs_wMaLtmeTiDl9l1uE0X3LVQhbwoyE2ymiAhDNWCVt5M-2gpQkzH9ZziXWD8DlK50lZBqzvdLFrm1ETxhWQZCRjJphxb1509ZonRWta39k6NG62p4vNswPcLGNW_xC1n_52EM2LGVQlpg3ZsnzC3AsrWaxPNCetyVoz5mpLWQ2BwAKsjy9JREkfSHot38chF8gziUzQ42eXQMGNIWqQVMbeK_fr3aYTShHtuAH1uMs4znPGUv9KRECAo_zof18UYqzjdVXeZ4P3QGaErDiNF1AZoLdHgwxWeWD31U9Vquw83q9iummpYuIL2cycZ6o60zGubzPW1RpbWo8TSDumjN2uQeC9BenKCOFjOIXeTTluQnuHMp6l8tVRHXXy9c8sbvtsTd2_11yA2eD2EsNrbwQBlRSnx-NVknOf-qOn8OGAjJhY7aTs2OaCvnYLKlAZGyM00wmNFGt30tc6siudg2KqNituWUftozChRu6Xx5VPfIKA0q8QVJt30V2S633TmBr-Pv4A4GbuUnE3lTFsG4c6m_0m5RBJJALSF_9TjIUlb-I_qQcY-ehNaWO6eSD06Gx-wsJr43LI3-n2JmooWMQt05Ydgxs6xgwkGn-OtoyeYHShhs3awHxHAljkl8PHo3n4z2JZYllLBBdD78142b0WnpKoWLNhLSw3EXJPAPYzR6VodwVlRlnR2BZKKnoRUm5zoUV97Tn_ohmtoXd7ZalRkikqBnKCCZdxo4uX9vPD9fhp5yllLKJMRSUkWyfQYGlvxP6VmltP8VDzvxYflsNIesSUVFLCtZUkx6HYT9FARw9D3nmYTmSD6SOjjvbGhb75Ymp3RBGYPW1hau1V17GXpIBLdK2lr_VBXTmjV-fAYyfCs7oqiNzmyDyg9MPImrgCbKU7wqZRkgW9JNeXe9hclYShV_opIgberKsFoik4siX5otj1n_NbdPRwRLOSJjIgdUoiTnWX3UCpxz-qAO-FcZax_DgdnFWPjcgtk0PDNQug1ff33Qg4nF_N0UfcfXFDKj0qFMMqXKELk9yrVufFCcoRxykd22vcH08C3d_JjFqXYFdHR-ZCQ_WExCkEDqjWN7OWcOJH6zMOa-k0dD9C0-HwalnpZzdMVfesk6775UFxnRc00LniM0wKhNU064QE1cVs8TWOOsi-Ui-o3FRtrpJgxgaHc-v4BFC91ws6iV6F7YOlV8PC73-anRu2gMElOJWUDYl2G-zJe4UKv-PUec0hAvzUtDy1Eer3JFN-sswZyCEYXJzRHzlFoDs2yKBW4PTvwDx-BnkL4na1TCVWy1LSS4Ga3uyYIBfhLrqX-PnQUgh46H86V6opZ9PZbtdOvAPm9GndLKRZxYbxtTabQ_8xvBA0aGgxbKhDRuz5jmso4YAleG9BY4OoemvTPFsD9ctvAFLk89-vm0XRV2VGTwiPziPe6MFtWuhsMUZouB0BOD3B3gV3DuwttQKzNwvK4KHQJNfFdiGmrG_d8Px4gouod8z39uLSdrNBpvWHh4LUkn1ZHrUlxYTA1fx3XYm4r_5Fi63v1iz5uXu3_tM8w4MB6TFI2AcJqzAY46yTwrLR_7xNn5OtDuUnT9polbUoS5GpA2DVJlTFpxk_S921BUtpIU2eOXRZ4TlYlNxW_KZazBMz0Lne0d0IMz6-V_CAvnvMs9arx0Xiu617d9Zm2LAhM2vl20ipygVp7jKyRe5r2yjJL-I7MWEPbIzLWVF0P_pbpOMrG5K55BA2-UrPmCV3927CwxK2cKLFUXUDWqkC0qLkJ33xzbhfBSFqvAOH-XQ_UfdI-d-Jx34FaMik1hAO0RSmLvC-wB-pQcDg2JiNxoVMeJmz1f6AhI_jxQJXC5lIDBYEhd74YKPJYeyqDOxv2e80RLjCeKfl685nC9fXWP6JKC2sG0Lt69z5OKXQt0MydeovdBivG5grZm7FPYi2BPw2E9iWHBFwcO1NzxojbLLJV9wJJAtA6g2O0KHTmbvix7ipTHVcGuSBjNfhcOEjNUjdQwidtKByLPM1hBoV4gFPAVPW41nj0ghFoS4LDIiHd_YrrGoT7l22hMBv_dK7sLaXYFhdjlwQAbmGTFI-MlDjZkRkaivrd53jF7S99ej3JjT_xZ-c8ljCtcbTLPWDQCXWly2m-hsiK2hW3Wxc77XXmavTK3585iUvvwpexWiJAvJsJl2mcvxbpzFQ_F8DGG0ECVVZIMFIkwXO3-79X_cIBlX-Yxhkf6SMBLlYetTvwldCxH5aSqCHlPEV-PdkjSEJR5UrbdMqZ2B90SJYtQvyGVugIlmdlPteBo4ld2RLEFyhu9ekHg_5l6hxQsDs_jarUzhYND6rJl-aGELLMiFNcgcziv2aorVt8lwiwxm3k_LnYvnmHih66Y2dCVnmXfsz3IwwDEkDWV0Yv3eqXADhj_erWXJ687DrA2Wb7c-4Ir2UzLR8C5-BxQ2jVfJHoHDuul-I81i9VO2qhiWClCrhv8zcucU80h6mcUhcYTcgP7rm_oFQPYiSl7fjA3PNs-Vz25FKE8F-Lq-gi-xH164GTRaI_A9Dw1YslVHo-63SOwWsJFA7DbJA9UxXALEoiUDRyCulPCSRZ-eyuVnS7qKYqa7N6X1RVac5zbucED7YtVMlwt-oO7QsihsJr6LodDqbl0fE1GAS-8KEooa918cX144XVx4xgNwrE7CAmAriMUhw9VuWZboEXq0BYxIX7va_BLMCpLngF_bLCi_REgZPsOlCY3v24UO8vUa0xvc48WuM_0wxbQVBKRODPnbIe1SXLEzxtDj3_2Qb0uBgHeJuO1zh1ivhnMtHL-uNJcfcJ9Ircye7kh6gW_ndPGegNfJlF_FTgxgnaUnLQ-hdwZ2zp5rSGL1VRwZGChj1CmkuhjLPN1Iy6fqj88BzlKA3Wqqqs0DOQGEFNgdhsSTVzRes7vQ9VVQIW15hezMHyWNXqdMdlLFdDs7gv9uT9rkU54ueU0os3DvpY3bABVd8hnfTTlrkeW238kDC9YgForedNk9GlgDvQ0SYH9fp4BVfeNc0mPmKub20b6mYf_gYYi_f5-yQlxY7PGmLoYAZt6bhc3pyIxXUNgeKJUN5OpYMMBuJO6_8Dw2ngcVaRqiMnRAi0-tx4VVbslnWoXrYYewzslpCNaTSmIrEf0gchP2FUAVDgP5G9_3XQHU-Ng7nrLoGQb31hAo7kHhqVBw4EMvxtqa1TyZ1tUtetE6EX8UWXlSieWVI0xqAjW1QHut6mQC8Bleu8RaQwytp29TK0MJr31yz-e1ZB8e_jeLCYc-MUvUdyt40bv76UGB4RTDHwlF-iDJPqGk2TfHKYZsJ6cdaa3gYHLntXSfsBG8SGdWo7SivvQfkTOKM1tvPqVhynWxxqASfWaZJhRfEJ3jOoKr8fU6doVfDs0C8xSt6h6LueBPDMWyNieDoThKbqZ7sY79c2wVkINiR8OTveIJZ4rxdTxk61MJGTDIdBoOV0DfaszNIfii5M58LwEK4yA1JyyvLGsOHNXrl8ejIbobC76UN4pJXGxeXi2Z_gANsLuNTDjnXOT17gQlDrJD61DHV-CzGW4b08rhJ3pDChIq_eOrVc4FqFhU-8a2vkSIb42edsTb_st1Y9jL_-IgxPw06IS_4ywAzAPyQtNNWr9KpCcqTlqtCxvAYNMikGXG_-NpcKaq3uVF_l9oHhBTnrOJVx78hW2XRccymTFZYv6QZRGh03IzhBH7yXGkBOCAqUKINuUPlXA-Lz7w5GUyHAAAQCGrH7vOBW8f2ZEXPcYhzm8NNuHivGZzcGEVAegsXkOx8cLVdMp8-Iyy6JrEeAMYo5X6F2gAAgSE_s8beYtJDqbcyacSCDn9Gtx0JkFelp5hOJ3CI3p4T2NtmbY84oJiYRLiPWefybNgzO7mT6xvamMURV4cpQb6BC_qgqA0Z7LqzvrNmuGGSh72rsxvcnRIQZWr2DnXLoRNRGWY6JKgRs2atkSiWUJ3i7Vyg7lN8PdO3wvHK1CHmvl8gqizAsis9KWQ-VN-SXSgl7slV3Kk9Ssn4gkia1Jci0d6VbEEEFq3_UEQ-2Hh4FlFUkghmH4L_Xun55tIb6sBXEO9NTzwmHa-rKAHEB-aJm87iMzdcBsvXQd0AfZVbt6GmN0HPzWcm1gBUGvJHbKTs8gPSFQjZxWKi4oYtGKjLWsJgd7zBoM0owZ6CvqxUFgHNofBtkRkjr-nYULs-HciFudjz2W7m64Hu0="}}
