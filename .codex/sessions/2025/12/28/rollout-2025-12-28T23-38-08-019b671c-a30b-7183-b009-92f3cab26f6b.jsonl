Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to see a trip overview with the latest entries first,\nso that I can quickly access the most recent updates.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I open a trip, when the trip overview loads, then I see the latest entries at the top in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest).\n2. Given the trip overview loads, then each entry shows its title, date, and a preview image.\n3. Given the trip has no entries, when I open the trip overview, then I see a clear empty state.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add a public trip overview API response for read-only viewing (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Create a public, unauthenticated read endpoint (new route) that returns trip metadata plus entry summaries for a trip\n  - [ ] Ensure response follows `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` formats\n  - [ ] Sort entries by `createdAt` descending (newest first) in the API or sort client-side consistently\n  - [ ] Return minimal fields needed for overview: `id`, `tripId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `coverImageUrl`, `media[]` (if needed for fallback preview)\n- [ ] Build trip overview UI for viewers (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Add a new public trip overview page (do not modify creator-only trip detail page)\n  - [ ] Render trip header plus entry cards sorted newest-first with title, date, and preview image\n  - [ ] Clicking an entry navigates to `/entries/:id` (public reader) without introducing new reader UI\n  - [ ] Render a clear empty state if the trip has no entries\n- [ ] Add tests (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] API test: overview returns newest-first ordering and includes required summary fields\n  - [ ] Component test: overview renders entry cards with title/date/preview and empty state when no entries\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- This story introduces a public trip overview so viewers can scan the newest entries first and jump into the latest update quickly.\n- UX expectations: media-first previews, clean entry list, and a calm, readable overview that reinforces the Atlas Path direction.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 focus is fast entry reading with clear navigation; this overview should funnel users into the existing entry reader.\n- Story 3.1 provides the public entry reader (`/entries/[id]`); reuse it for navigation targets.\n- Story 3.2 added entry navigation; do not recreate navigation logic here.\n- Story 4 (shareable links) is not in scope; do not add link-generation or access controls beyond public read.\n\n### UX Requirements\n- Latest entry appears at the top of the overview list (reverse chronological order).\n- Each entry card shows title, date, and a preview image.\n- Empty state should be friendly, clear, and avoid dead-end UI.\n- Maintain typography (Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body) and warm palette from UX spec.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Keep the overview read-only and public (no auth required) to align with viewer access.\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for entry preview images.\n- Preview image selection priority:\n  1) `coverImageUrl` (if present),\n  2) first media URL,\n  3) first inline image from entry text (if already available in summary),\n  4) fallback placeholder.\n- Do not return full entry text for the overview unless required for preview extraction; prefer summary fields.\n\n### API Contract Notes\n- Introduce a public read endpoint separate from creator-only trip/entry APIs.\n- Response shape must be `{ data, error }` with errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Suggested response payload:\n  - `trip: { id, title, startDate, endDate, coverImageUrl }`\n  - `entries: [{ id, tripId, title, createdAt, coverImageUrl, media[] }]`\n\n### Performance & Accessibility Guardrails\n- Keep overview payload small; avoid heavy media lists if not needed for previews.\n- Ensure list layout is responsive and uses 44x44 touch targets for entry cards.\n- Provide clear focus states for keyboard navigation.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; new public overview page should be in `src/app/`.\n- REST endpoints are plural and live under `src/app/api`.\n- Use feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` only.\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript.\n- Tailwind CSS styling; reuse existing tokens/palette.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 for data access; Zod 4.2.1 for validation if needed.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- New public overview page: `src/app/...` (create a new route; do not alter `src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx` creator view).\n- New UI component: `src/components/trips/` (e.g., `trip-overview.tsx` or `trip-overview-card.tsx`).\n- New public API route: `src/app/api/...` (separate from authenticated trip routes).\n- Tests: `tests/api/` and `tests/components/` only.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- API: verify response ordering (newest first) and required fields.\n- Components: verify entry cards render title/date/preview image and empty state displays.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 3.2)\n- Public entry reader exists at `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`; link overview cards to this route.\n- Preserve media-first reading flow; overview is a gateway, not a new reader.\n- Keep response shape and error format consistent with existing API tests.\n\n### Recent Git History Signals\n- Recent work focused on entry reader UI and media viewer patterns.\n- Reuse existing entry/media utilities (e.g., inline image extraction) instead of duplicating logic.\n- Keep styling consistent with entry reader and trip detail components.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Deferred)\n- No web research performed; use pinned versions from `_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- App Router only; API routes in `src/app/api`.\n- Response shape `{ data, error }`, errors `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Components `PascalCase`, files `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Tests in central `tests/` only.\n- Use `next/image` with lazy loading for media.\n\n### References\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.3: Trip Overview with Latest Entries]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Core User Experience]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Component Strategy]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n- [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Add public overview API (read-only trip + entry summaries) with newest-first ordering.\n- Add public trip overview page and entry cards linking to `/entries/:id`.\n- Add API/component tests for ordering, summary fields, and empty state.\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-29: Story 3.3 created.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: ready-for-dev\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Tests will come first to validate rendering with and without entries, mocking Next Image and Link for jsdom. The plan follows a test-driven approach with red-green-refactor cycles, running the test suite after implementation, and finally updating the story file to track
