Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to navigate between entries in a trip,\nso that I can move through the story in order.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Given I am viewing an entry in a trip, when I select next or previous entry, then I am taken to that entry without leaving the entry reader.\n2. Given I am viewing an entry in a trip, when I select next or previous entry, then the entry content updates within the single-page view.\n3. Given I am on the first or last entry, when I attempt to navigate past the bounds, then the unavailable direction is disabled or clearly indicated.\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add navigation metadata to the public entry read flow (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Extend `GET /api/entries/[id]` to return adjacent entry IDs (and optional titles/dates) in chronological order\n  - [ ] Ensure navigation respects the same trip ordering used in trip timelines (oldest → newest)\n  - [ ] Keep `{ data, error }` response shape and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- [ ] Update entry reader UI to render navigation controls (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Add previous/next controls that link to `/entries/:id` and preserve the reader layout\n  - [ ] Disable or visually indicate unavailable direction at bounds\n  - [ ] Keep typography, spacing, and palette consistent with the reader layout (Fraunces + Source Serif 4, warm palette)\n- [ ] Confirm navigation behavior stays in the single-page reader experience (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Use App Router route transitions only; no separate pages or dialogs\n  - [ ] Preserve reader layout and media-first hierarchy during navigation\n- [ ] Add tests (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] API test: entry response includes correct prev/next metadata for a trip\n  - [ ] Component test: navigation controls render and respect disabled bounds\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context (Purpose + UX Intent)\n- This story adds entry-to-entry navigation inside the existing single-page reader from Story 3.1.\n- Maintain the immersive, media-first reading flow; navigation should feel lightweight and not disrupt the reading context.\n- UX expectations: clear directional cues, obvious disabled states at first/last entries, no new page chrome.\n\n### Epic Context and Dependencies\n- Epic 3 goal: fast, media-first entry reading with clear navigation.\n- Story 3.1 already created the entry reader layout; reuse and extend it.\n- Story 3.3 will add trip overview; do not fold overview responsibilities into this story.\n- Do not alter the private creator entry detail route (`/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]`) or `EntryDetail` UI; navigation applies to the public reader only.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Base ordering for navigation is chronological by `createdAt` (oldest → newest).\n- Add navigation metadata to the public entry read response (recommended fields):\n  - `previousEntryId` and `nextEntryId`\n  - Optional: `previousEntryTitle`, `nextEntryTitle`, `previousEntryDate`, `nextEntryDate` if needed for UI labels\n- Use a single additional Prisma query to resolve adjacent entries; avoid N+1 patterns.\n- Keep entry read path public for shared viewing; do not add auth gating to `/entries/:id` that blocks viewers.\n- Preserve error shape `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Do not return adjacent entries from a different trip; adjacent resolution must be scoped to the current entry's `tripId`.\n\n### Security and Performance Guardrails\n- Public entry navigation must not expand access beyond the current trip or entry scope.\n- Enforce trip scoping at the query level (adjacent entries filtered by `tripId`).\n- Keep the adjacent lookup O(1) queries: a single query per direction with `createdAt` ordering.\n- If a composite index on `(tripId, createdAt)` exists, use it implicitly; do not add migrations in this story unless required.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n- App Router only; public entry view stays in `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- REST handlers stay under `src/app/api`.\n- Server-side data fetching; client components only for UI interactivity as needed.\n- Validation is server-side only (Zod).\n\n### Library / Framework Requirements\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript.\n- Tailwind CSS styling; match existing palette and layout tokens.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 for DB access, Zod 4.2.1 for validation.\n\n### Latest Tech Verification (Explicitly Deferred)\n- No web research performed. Follow pinned versions in `_bmad-output/architecture.md` and `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n- Defer external version checks because this story is a UI + API contract change using existing stack components only.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence (Story 3.1)\n- `EntryReader` already implements media-first layout and body rendering; extend it rather than re-creating the reader.\n- Public entry view route already exists: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx` uses `/api/entries/[id]` and maps to `EntryReader`.\n- `EntryDetail` and trip-specific entry pages are separate and should remain unchanged.\n- Tests exist for entry reader and API shape; align new tests with current patterns in `tests/components/` and `tests/api/`.\n- No recorded review corrections from Story 3.1; treat existing reader as the baseline for UI/UX.\n\n### Recent Git History Signals\n- Recent commits focused on entry media handling and reader UI (Stories 2.6 and 2.8).\n- Reuse existing entry/media component patterns; avoid duplicating gallery or viewer logic.\n- Keep API response shapes consistent with current tests expecting `{ data, error }`.\n\n### Data Model and API Contract Notes\n- Entries include `id`, `tripId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `media[]`, and `text`.\n- Navigation metadata should be derived by `tripId` and `createdAt` ordering.\n- Do not change response wrapper or error format.\n- Suggested response extension:\n  - `navigation: { previousEntryId: string | null, nextEntryId: string | null, previousEntryTitle?: string, nextEntryTitle?: string, previousEntryDate?: string, nextEntryDate?: string }`\n\n### Edge Cases to Cover\n- Trip with a single entry: both directions disabled, `previousEntryId` and `nextEntryId` are null.\n- First entry in trip: previous disabled; last entry: next disabled.\n- Entries with missing title: fall back to date or \"Daily entry\" label.\n- Entry with no media: navigation still renders and does not depend on media presence.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n- Entry reader UI: `src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx` (extend with navigation controls).\n- Public reader route: `src/app/entries/[id]/page.tsx`.\n- API handler: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (extend response).\n- Tests: `tests/api/` and `tests/components/` only (no co-located tests).\n\n### Reuse / Anti-Pattern Guidance\n- Reuse `EntryReader` and existing layout styles; do not create a second reader.\n- Avoid introducing new route trees; navigation should use existing `/entries/:id`.\n- Do not introduce new state management libraries or RTK Query.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Component tests under `tests/components/entries/`.\n- API tests under `tests/api/` and must assert `{ data, error }` shape.\n- Test scenarios to include:\n  - API: returns correct prev/next IDs for middle entry; nulls for bounds.\n  - UI: navigation buttons render with correct hrefs and disabled states at bounds.\n  - UI: navigating updates content and keeps reader layout (snapshot or DOM assertions).\n\n### Regression Checklist\n- Entry reader layout remains media-first with existing typography and spacing.\n- `/entries/:id` stays public for shared viewing.\n- `/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]` flow remains creator-only and unchanged.\n- Entry list ordering and trip overview behavior remain unaffected.\n\n### Scope Boundaries (Prevent Creep)\n- Do not implement trip overview or timeline browsing UI here (Story 3.3).\n- Do not add sharing or role management features (Epic 4/5).\n- Do not change media upload, entry editing, or trip management flows.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n- Follow `kebab-case.tsx` file naming and `PascalCase` components.\n- Keep utilities in `src/utils/` and avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Done Criteria\n- ACs 1-3 pass, navigation metadata is returned by API, and UI controls render with correct disabled states.\n- API and component tests for navigation pass in `tests/`.\n\n### References\n- [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 3.2: Entry Navigation]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Navigation Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules]\n\n### Project Context Reference\n- App Router only;

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
