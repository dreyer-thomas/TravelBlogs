[Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2] [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- API routes must stay in App Router under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints and `{ data, error }` response wrapper. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns] [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Validation is server-side only with Zod 4.2.1; require text and at least one photo (mediaUrls or inline image markdown). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture] [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite with singular models and camelCase fields; update Entry + EntryMedia records accordingly.

[Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points] [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Maintain chronological ordering and keep the entry reader responsive after edits. [Source: _bmad-output/prd.md#Navigation & Viewing] [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Update entry API: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (add PUT/PATCH). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Edit UI in `src/components/entries/` (new `edit-entry-form.tsx` or extend `create-entry-form.tsx`); file names in kebab-case.

[Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Require text and at least one photo (either mediaUrls or inline image markdown). [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Preserve `{ data, error }` response wrapper with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Enforce creator-only access and trip ownership checks for updates. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Return ISO 8601 timestamps in API responses. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Language-Specific Rules]\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; REST routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Prisma + SQLite with singular models and camelCase fields. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for media previews and gallery. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Prisma 7.2.0; SQLite datasource. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions; creator-only access for updates. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Typography uses `next/font` with Fraunces + Source Serif 4 for entry editing UI. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Typography System]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Update handler: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (PUT/PATCH). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Edit UI: `src/components/entries/` (kebab-case file names). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Optional page route: `src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Shared helpers in `src/utils/` (reuse `entry-content` and `entry-media`). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add API tests under `tests/api/entries` for update success, validation errors, and unauthorized access. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add component test for edit form validation and submit behavior. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 2.1 already implemented: entry creation uses `/api/entries` POST with Zod validation and media requirement. Mirror the same validation logic for updates to keep behavior consistent. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Technical Requirements]\n- Media uploads use `/api/media/upload` via `src/utils/entry-media.ts` and inline image markdown parsing in `src/utils/entry-content.ts`. Reuse these utilities for edit flow. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Dev Notes]\n- Entry detail UI renders inline images and a gallery; edits should refresh both text and media display. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Dev Notes]\n\n## Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commit patterns show API handlers returning `{ data, error }` with a shared `jsonError` helper and auth via `getToken` with creator checks. Follow the same pattern for update endpoint. [Source: git log -5]\n- Tests use Vitest + PrismaBetterSqlite3 with `npx prisma migrate deploy` in `beforeAll`. Match this setup for edit tests. [Source: travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, API conventions, response format, and testing locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed; comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - None\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Story context generated from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context sources.\n - Included previous story and git intelligence to align edit flow with existing patterns.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-2-edit-blog-entry.md\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/prd.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to edit an existing blog entry,\nso that I can fix mistakes or add more detail.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing an entry I own  \n   **When** I update the entry text or media and save  \n   **Then** the changes are persisted  \n   **And** the updated entry is shown in the entry view\n2. **Given** I submit invalid updates (missing required text or invalid media)  \n   **When** I attempt to save  \n   **Then** I see clear validation errors  \n   **And** the changes are not saved\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Define edit entry payload and validation (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Zod schema requiring text and at least one photo (mediaUrls or inline image markdown)\n  - [ ] Validate media URLs are non-empty strings; reject invalid payloads with standard error wrapper\n- [ ] Implement update entry API flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add PUT (or PATCH) handler in `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Enforce creator-only auth and trip ownership checks\n  - [ ] Update entry text and media set; refresh updatedAt\n- [ ] Build creator UI for entry editing (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Edit form with text + media (reuse entry-media utilities and inline image helpers)\n  - [ ] Preload existing entry text and media; allow removal and re-upload\n  - [ ] Inline validation errors; disable submit while invalid or uploading\n- [ ] Update entry detail view to surface edit action (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Add edit CTA in entry view\n  - [ ] Navigate to edit screen or inline edit mode\n- [ ] Add tests for edit flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests for update success, validation error, and unauthorized access\n  - [ ] Component test for edit form validation and submit states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Edit entry updates text and media for an existing entry; keep media-first UX and show updated content in the entry view. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2] [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader]\n- API routes must stay in App Router under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints and `{ data, error }` response wrapper. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns] [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Validation is server-side only with Zod 4.2.1; require text and at least one photo (mediaUrls or inline image markdown). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture] [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite with singular models and camelCase fields; update Entry + EntryMedia records accordingly. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture] [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Language-Specific Rules]\n- Media upload uses the existing `/api/media/upload` and entry media utilities; keep Next.js Image for previews. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points] [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Maintain chronological ordering and keep the entry reader responsive after edits. [Source: _bmad-output/prd.md#Navigation & Viewing] [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Update entry API: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (add PUT/PATCH). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Edit UI in `src/components/entries/` (new `edit-entry-form.tsx` or extend `create-entry-form.tsx`); file names in kebab-case. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Page route for edit (if separate): `src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Tests remain under `tests/` with `tests/api/entries` and `tests/components`. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n### References\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2\n- _bmad-output/prd.md#Entry Management\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Entry Reader\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md#Critical Implementation Rules\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Update an existing entry's text and media; reject invalid updates with clear validation errors. [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Require text and at least one photo (either mediaUrls or inline image markdown). [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Preserve `{ data, error }` response wrapper with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Enforce creator-only access and trip ownership checks for updates. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Return ISO 8601 timestamps in API responses. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Language-Specific Rules]\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; REST routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Prisma + SQLite with singular models and camelCase fields. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for media previews and gallery. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Prisma 7.2.0; SQLite datasource. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions; creator-only access for updates. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Typography uses `next/font` with Fraunces + Source Serif 4 for entry editing UI. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Typography System]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Update handler: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (PUT/PATCH). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Edit UI: `src/components/entries/` (kebab-case file names). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Optional page route: `src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Shared helpers in `src/utils/` (reuse `entry-content` and `entry-media`). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add API tests under `tests/api/entries` for update success, validation errors, and unauthorized access. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add component test for edit form validation and submit behavior. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 2.1 already implemented: entry creation uses `/api/entries` POST with Zod validation and media requirement. Mirror the same validation logic for updates to keep behavior consistent. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Technical Requirements]\n- Media uploads use `/api/media/upload` via `src/utils/entry-media.ts` and inline image markdown parsing in `src/utils/entry-content.ts`. Reuse these utilities for edit flow. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Dev Notes]\n- Entry detail UI renders inline images and a gallery; edits should refresh both text and media display. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Dev Notes]\n\n## Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commit patterns show API handlers returning `{ data, error }` with a shared `jsonError` helper and auth via `getToken` with creator checks. Follow the same pattern for update endpoint. [Source: git log -5]\n- Tests use Vitest + PrismaBetterSqlite3 with `npx prisma migrate deploy` in `beforeAll`. Match this setup for edit tests. [Source: travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, API conventions, response format, and testing locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed; comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - None\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Story context generated from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context sources.\n - Included previous story and git intelligence to align edit flow with existing patterns.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-2-edit-blog-entry.md\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/prd.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n"}}

[Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Require text and at least one photo (either mediaUrls or inline image markdown). [Source: _bmad-output/epics.md#Story 2.2]\n- Preserve `{ data, error }` response wrapper with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Enforce creator-only access and trip ownership checks for updates. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Return ISO 8601 timestamps in API responses. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Language-Specific Rules]\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; REST routes live under `src/app/api` with plural endpoints. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Prisma + SQLite with singular models and camelCase fields. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for media previews and gallery. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Prisma 7.2.0; SQLite datasource. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions; creator-only access for updates. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n- Typography uses `next/font` with Fraunces + Source Serif 4 for entry editing UI. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md#Typography System]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Update handler: `src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts` (PUT/PATCH). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Edit UI: `src/components/entries/` (kebab-case file names). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n- Optional page route: `src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Shared helpers in `src/utils/` (reuse `entry-content` and `entry-media`). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add API tests under `tests/api/entries` for update success, validation errors, and unauthorized access. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add component test for edit form validation and submit behavior. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 2.1 already implemented: entry creation uses `/api/entries` POST with Zod validation and media requirement. Mirror the same validation logic for updates to keep behavior consistent. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Technical Requirements]\n- Media uploads use `/api/media/upload` via `src/utils/entry-media.ts` and inline image markdown parsing in `src/utils/entry-content.ts`. Reuse these utilities for edit flow. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Dev Notes]\n- Entry detail UI renders inline images and a gallery; edits should refresh both text and media display. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-add-blog-entry.md#Dev Notes]\n\n## Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commit patterns show API handlers returning `{ data, error }` with a shared `jsonError` helper and auth via `getToken` with creator checks. Follow the same pattern for update endpoint. [Source: git log -5]\n- Tests use Vitest + PrismaBetterSqlite3 with `npx prisma migrate deploy` in `beforeAll`. Match this setup for edit tests. [Source: travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, API conventions, response format, and testing locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed; comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - None\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Story context generated from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context sources.\n - Included previous story and git intelligence to align edit flow with existing patterns.\n - Implemented entry update validation and PATCH API with media replacement and ownership checks.\n - Added edit entry UI with preloaded content, media management, and edit CTA in entry detail.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n\n### File List\n\n- src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx\n- src/components/entries/edit-entry-form.tsx\n- src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\n- tests/api/entries/update-entry.test.ts\n- tests/components/edit-entry-form.test.tsx\n"}}
