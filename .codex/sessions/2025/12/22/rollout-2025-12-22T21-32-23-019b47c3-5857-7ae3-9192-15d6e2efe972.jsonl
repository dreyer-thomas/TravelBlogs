Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to see a list of my trips,\nso that I can quickly access and manage them.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator with one or more trips\n   **When** I open the trips area\n   **Then** I see a list of my trips with basic metadata (title, dates, cover)\n2. **Given** I have no trips yet\n   **When** I open the trips area\n   **Then** I see an empty state with a clear call to create a trip\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Trip list data (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Ensure `GET /api/trips` returns creator-owned trips with `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, and `updatedAt`\n  - [ ] Enforce creator-only access with Auth.js session checks\n  - [ ] Return `{ data, error }` and ISO 8601 date strings\n- [ ] Trip list UI (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Render the trip list in `src/app/trips/page.tsx` using server-side data fetching\n  - [ ] Show trip cards with cover image, title, and date range\n  - [ ] Link each card to `/trips/:id`\n- [ ] Empty state UX (AC: 2)\n  - [ ] Show a friendly empty state with a primary CTA to create a trip\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add API tests for list success + unauthorized\n  - [ ] Add component test for list + empty state if component harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation, deletion, and metadata edit already exist; reuse their auth, API response, and error patterns.\n- The trip detail page already renders metadata and uses owner checks; keep list links consistent with `/trips/:id`.\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes, auth helpers, or response utilities.\n- Performance guardrail: avoid loading full trip details; list should only fetch the fields needed for cards.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** `GET /api/trips` in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` must return creator-owned trips only.\n- **Auth:** Use the same Auth.js session check as existing trip endpoints (`getToken` + creator validation).\n- **Data:** Return `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt` at minimum.\n- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n- **Ordering:** Preserve any existing ordering; if adding ordering, use `updatedAt` desc for most-recent-first and document it in code.\n- **Pagination:** If list size grows, add simple `limit`/`offset` (camelCase) with safe defaults (e.g., `limit=20`).\n- **Errors:** Always return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; all API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests must live under `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Shared helpers live in `src/utils/`; do not add `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite for data access.\n- Zod 4.2.1 only if validation is needed (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 only if existing list state pattern requires it; prefer server rendering.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (`GET` list) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for detail actions.\n- UI: `src/app/trips/page.tsx` plus `src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx` or `src/components/trips/trip-list.tsx`.\n- Utils: `src/utils/` for shared formatting helpers if required (avoid `lib/`).\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/trip-list.test.tsx` (if harness exists).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests: list success, unauthorized, and response shape assertions.\n- Component tests if harness exists: list renders metadata, empty state CTA visible when no trips.\n- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Trip cards show cover image (if present), title, and date range in a scannable layout.\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for cover images.\n- Empty state includes a clear primary CTA to create a trip.\n- Empty state copy: “No trips yet. Create your first trip to start capturing your journey.”\n- Preserve existing visual language: ivory background, terracotta accents, teal primary, Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 1.4 established `PATCH /api/trips/[id]` with creator-only auth, `{ data, error }` responses, and ISO 8601 dates.\n- Trip detail page already loads data server-side and uses owner checks; mirror that pattern for list rendering.\n- Validation and error handling patterns should match create/edit/delete trip endpoints to avoid regressions.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies\n\n- Relies on Story 1.2 (Create Trip) for Trip model fields and create flow.\n- Should align with Story 1.3/1.4 list refresh patterns and auth checks to avoid drift.\n\n### Data Model Notes\n\n- Trip model fields used by list: `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`, `ownerId`.\n- Ownership filter must use `ownerId` from Auth.js session to prevent cross-user data exposure.\n\n### Security Notes\n\n- List endpoint must be creator-only; viewers should never receive trip data.\n- Return `UNAUTHORIZED` for missing/invalid sessions and `FORBIDDEN` for non-creator roles.\n\n### Performance Notes\n\n- Fetch only list fields; avoid loading entries or media payloads.\n- If you add pagination, default to small limits and document query params.\n\n### Environment & Deployment Notes\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example` only; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### Integration Notes\n\n- Use Prisma client via existing `src/utils/db.ts`.\n- Use Next.js Image for cover rendering (lazy-load).\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Most recent commit: `2025015` \"Story 1-4 edit trip metadata\".\n- Expect recent patterns in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`, `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`, and `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Recent Test Patterns\n\n- Follow existing `tests/api/trips/*.test.ts` conventions for auth + response shape assertions.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Global rules live in `_bmad-output/project-context.md` (App Router, REST routes under `src/app/api`, `{ data, error }` wrapper, plural endpoints, camelCase JSON, tests in `tests/`).\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.5)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (cards, typography, accessibility)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-4-edit-trip-metadata.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history reviewed; single recent commit used for pattern alignment.\n- Previous story learnings captured for API/auth/response consistency.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-5-view-trip-list.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-22: Created ready-for-dev story context for trip list view.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: ready-for-dev\n\nCompletion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n"}}
