Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to see a list of my trips,\nso that I can quickly access and manage them.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator with one or more trips\n   **When** I open the trips area\n   **Then** I see a list of my trips with basic metadata (title, dates, cover)\n2. **Given** I have no trips yet\n   **When** I open the trips area\n   **Then** I see an empty state with a clear call to create a trip\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Trip list data (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Ensure `GET /api/trips` returns creator-owned trips with `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, and `updatedAt`\n  - [x] Enforce creator-only access with Auth.js session checks\n  - [x] Return `{ data, error }` and ISO 8601 date strings\n- [x] Trip list UI (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Render the trip list in `src/app/trips/page.tsx` using server-side data fetching\n  - [x] Show trip cards with cover image, title, and date range\n  - [x] Link each card to `/trips/:id`\n- [x] Empty state UX (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Show a friendly empty state with a primary CTA to create a trip\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add API tests for list success + unauthorized\n  - [x] Add component test for list + empty state if component harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation, deletion, and metadata edit already exist; reuse their auth, API response, and error patterns.\n- The trip detail page already renders metadata and uses owner checks; keep list links consistent with `/trips/:id`.\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes, auth helpers, or response utilities.\n- Performance guardrail: avoid loading full trip details; list should only fetch the fields needed for cards.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** `GET /api/trips` in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` must return creator-owned trips only.\n- **Auth:** Use the same Auth.js session check as existing trip endpoints (`getToken` + creator validation).\n- **Data:** Return `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt` at minimum.\n- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n- **Ordering:** Preserve any existing ordering; if adding ordering, use `updatedAt` desc for most-recent-first and document it in code.\n- **Pagination:** If list size grows, add simple `limit`/`offset` (camelCase) with safe defaults (e.g., `limit=20`).\n- **Errors:** Always return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; all API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests must live under `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Shared helpers live in `src/utils/`; do not add `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite for data access.\n- Zod 4.2.1 only if validation is needed (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 only if existing list state pattern requires it; prefer server rendering.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (`GET` list) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for detail actions.\n- UI: `src/app/trips/page.tsx` plus `src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx` or `src/components/trips/trip-list.tsx`.\n- Utils: `src/utils/` for shared formatting helpers if required (avoid `lib/`).\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/trip-list.test.tsx` (if harness exists).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests: list success, unauthorized, and response shape assertions.\n- Component tests if harness exists: list renders metadata, empty state CTA visible when no trips.\n- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Trip cards show cover image (if present), title, and date range in a scannable layout.\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for cover images.\n- Empty state includes a clear primary CTA to create a trip.\n- Empty state copy: “No trips yet. Create your first trip to start capturing your journey.”\n- Preserve existing visual language: ivory background, terracotta accents, teal primary, Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 1.4 established `PATCH /api/trips/[id]` with creator-only auth, `{ data, error }` responses, and ISO 8601 dates.\n- Trip detail page already loads data server-side and uses owner checks; mirror that pattern for list rendering.\n- Validation and error handling patterns should match create/edit/delete trip endpoints to avoid regressions.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies\n\n- Relies on Story 1.2 (Create Trip) for Trip model fields and create flow.\n- Should align with Story 1.3/1.4 list refresh patterns and auth checks to avoid drift.\n\n### Data Model Notes\n\n- Trip model fields used by list: `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`, `ownerId`.\n- Ownership filter must use `ownerId` from Auth.js session to prevent cross-user data exposure.\n\n### Security Notes\n\n- List endpoint must be creator-only; viewers should never receive trip data.\n- Return `UNAUTHORIZED` for missing/invalid sessions and `FORBIDDEN` for non-creator roles.\n\n### Performance Notes\n\n- Fetch only list fields; avoid loading entries or media payloads.\n- If you add pagination, default to small limits and document query params.\n\n### Environment & Deployment Notes\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example` only; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### Integration Notes\n\n- Use Prisma client via existing `src/utils/db.ts`.\n- Use Next.js Image for cover rendering (lazy-load).\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Most recent commit: `2025015` \"Story 1-4 edit trip metadata\".\n- Expect recent patterns in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`, `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`, and `src/components/trips/`.\n\n### Recent Test Patterns\n\n- Follow existing `tests/api/trips/*.test.ts` conventions for auth + response shape assertions.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- Global rules live in `_bmad-output/project-context.md` (App Router, REST routes under `src/app/api`, `{ data, error }` wrapper, plural endpoints, camelCase JSON, tests in `tests/`).\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.5)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (cards, typography, accessibility)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-4-edit-trip-metadata.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Add list endpoint for creator-only trips with ISO date serialization.\n- Render server-side trip list with card layout and cover images.\n- Provide empty state CTA and validate with API tests.\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history reviewed; single recent commit used for pattern alignment.\n- Previous story learnings captured for API/auth/response consistency.\n- Implemented `GET /api/trips` with creator-only access and ISO date list response.\n- Added list API tests and confirmed `npm test` passes.\n- Rendered server-side trip list UI with cover-image cards and detail links.\n- Added empty state copy and primary CTA for new trips.\n- Component test skipped: no component test harness present in `tests/components`.\n- Marked story status as review and updated sprint status.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-5-view-trip-list.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-22: Created ready-for-dev story context for trip list view.\n- 2025-12-22: Implemented trip list API, UI, empty state, and tests.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\nStatus: review\n\nCompletion note: Trip list view implemented with API, UI, empty state, and tests passing.\n"}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nWarm, human-readable pairing optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Fraunces` (expressive, travel-journal feel)\n- Body: `Source Serif 4` (highly readable long-form)\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative; CTA and title are focusable.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Keep latest entry preview under 2 lines.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap preview opens latest entry.\n\n### Timeline Entry Card\n\n**Purpose:** Enable fast scanning and navigation through the trip.  \n**Usage:** Timeline list and search results.  \n**Anatomy:** Thumbnail/media strip, title, date, location, short summary.  \n**States:** Default, hover, selected, unread/new.  \n**Variants:** Compact (list), rich (media-heavy).  \n**Accessibility:** Entire card is a link; ensure visible focus state.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Summary capped at 120 chars.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap to open entry detail.\n\n### Trip Switcher Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Switch between trips without confusion.  \n**Usage:** Global navigation.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip list with cover thumb, dates, last updated.  \n**States:** Default, selected, empty.  \n**Variants:** Drawer (mobile), popover (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation through list items.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting a trip returns to its latest entry.\n\n### Entry Reader\n\n**Purpose:** Long-form reading with immersive media.  \n**Usage:** Entry detail view.  \n**Anatomy:** Title, meta, media gallery, text body, map snippet.  \n**States:** Default, loading, error.  \n**Variants:** Read-only, contributor-editable.  \n**Accessibility:** Type size 17-18px minimum; skip-to-content.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Scrollable story, sticky top bar for navigation.\n\n### Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Keep spatial context while browsing entries.  \n**Usage:** Trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Map with pins + timeline list.  \n**States:** Default, selected pin, no location data.  \n**Variants:** Side-by-side (desktop), stacked (mobile).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard pin navigation; map has list alternative.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting pin highlights timeline entry.\n\n### Share/Invite Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Enable viewer access without friction.  \n**Usage:** Trip settings/share.  \n**Anatomy:** Share link, copy button, invite fields (optional).  \n**States:** Default, copied, error.  \n**Variants:** Minimal (link only), full (invite list).  \n**Accessibility:** Clear labels and focus feedback.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Copy link shows success state.\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Build custom components on top of design system tokens.\n- Keep core controls consistent with system defaults.\n- Prioritize accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation).\n- Use shared layout primitives for spacing consistency.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (Core Journeys):**\n- Active Trip Hero\n- Timeline Entry Card\n- Entry Reader\n\n**Phase 2 (Navigation + Context):**\n- Trip Switcher Panel\n- Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Phase 3 (Sharing):**\n- Share/Invite Panel\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**When to Use:** Primary for the single most important action; secondary for supportive actions; destructive only when necessary.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Primary: Teal filled buttons  \n- Secondary: Ghost style (text + subtle hover)  \n- Destructive: Clay red with clear label  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Only one primary action per view  \n- Destructive actions require confirm modal  \n**Accessibility:** Clear focus states and minimum 44px touch targets  \n**Mobile Considerations:** Primary action anchored near thumb-reach when possible\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Trip creation, entry creation/editing, sharing.  \n**Visual Design:** Labels above fields with asterisk for required fields.  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Inline validation as users type  \n- Errors appear below field with gentle, human language  \n- Submit disabled until required fields are valid  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Associate labels/inputs  \n- Error text announced by screen readers  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Large tap targets and clear spacing between inputs\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Global navigation, trip switching, entry browsing.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Desktop: Sidebar navigation with hamburger menu  \n- Mobile: Bottom button bar for primary sections  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Latest entry is visible on entry, but no persistent CTA  \n- Trips are always accessible via the nav  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Keyboard support for sidebar menu  \n- Clear active state indicator  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Bottom bar stays visible during scrolling\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop:** Map + timeline side-by-side for maximum context.\n- **Tablet:** Stacked layout (map above timeline) to keep reading simple.\n- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with bottom navigation for primary sections.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- **Mobile:** <768px  \n- **Tablet:** 768-1023px  \n- **Desktop:** 1024px+\n\nMobile-first layout with progressive enhancement for larger screens.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- Target **WCAG AA** compliance.\n- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.\n- Visible focus states for all interactive elements.\n- Minimum 44x44px touch targets.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Basic accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast checks.\n- Responsive device checks across mobile/tablet/desktop in major browsers.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary.\n- Support keyboard navigation for menus and drawers.\n- Keep line lengths and spacing optimized for readability.\n- Avoid hover-only interactions; ensure touch parity.\n"}}

Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast.\n- UX typography: Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body, body size 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars.\n- UX color tokens: warm terracotta primary, deep teal secondary, ivory/sand surfaces, charcoal text with defined semantic colors.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 5 - Admin creates users  \nFR2: Epic 5 - Role assignment  \nFR3: Epic 5 -

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to sign in with email and password,\nso that only I can create and edit trips and entries.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** the app is configured with a single creator account\n   **When** I submit valid credentials\n   **Then** I am signed in and can access trip management routes\n2. **Given** I submit invalid credentials\n   **When** I attempt to sign in\n   **Then** I see a clear error and remain signed out\n3. **Given** I am not signed in\n   **When** I attempt to access trip or entry management routes\n   **Then** I am redirected to sign in\n4. **Given** I open a shareable trip link\n   **When** the trip loads\n   **Then** I can view the trip without signing in\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Configure Auth.js single-creator sign-in (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add Auth.js route at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` with Credentials provider and JWT sessions\n  - [x] Load creator credentials from `.env` (mirror keys in `.env.example`; do not use `.env.local`)\n  - [x] Validate credentials server-side; return a clear error message on failure\n  - [x] Do not add Prisma models or DB tables for users in this story\n- [x] Add sign-in UI and flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Create `src/app/sign-in/page.tsx` with email/password form and error state\n  - [x] Wire sign-in to Auth.js credentials flow and redirect to trips management on success\n- [x] Protect management routes (AC: 3)\n  - [x] Add session checks in `src/middleware.ts` for management paths\n  - [x] Protect at minimum: `src/app/trips/` (manage), `src/app/entries/` (manage), any create/edit routes for trips/entries\n  - [x] Redirect unauthenticated users to sign-in\n- [x] Keep shareable links public (AC: 4)\n  - [x] Exclude public trip/entry view routes (shareable link pages) from auth gating\n  - [x] Treat read-only trip/entry viewers as public until Epic 4 defines a share-link route\n- [x] Add tests for auth guard behavior (AC: 1-4)\n  - [x] Place tests under `tests/` (e.g., `tests/api/auth`, `tests/components/auth`)\n  - [x] Cover: valid sign-in, invalid sign-in, redirect on protected routes, public access to shareable links\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Epic 0 goal: enable lightweight creator-only access for trip/entry management while keeping sharing public.\n- Cross-story context: Story 1.1 initializes the Next.js project; this auth work assumes the app exists but does not require user tables yet.\n- Epic 0 contains only this story; no cross-story dependencies within Epic 0.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions is required; keep auth routes under `src/app/api/auth` only.\n- MVP is a single creator account; avoid creating a full user table yet and do not add Prisma models in this story.\n- Store creator credentials in `.env` and document in `.env.example`; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- Schema note: no database schema changes are required for this story; Auth.js credentials are environment-backed only.\n- Shareable trip links must remain public; do not require sign-in for viewer access.\n- Follow response wrapper `{ data, error }` and error shape `{ error: { code, message } }` for any custom API responses.\n- Use App Router only; components in feature folders; tests in central `tests/`.\n- Performance guardrail: avoid heavy client-side auth checks that could impact entry navigation (<1s) or trip switching (2-5s). Use middleware + server checks.\n- Regression guardrail: do not block any read-only trip or entry view routes used by shareable links.\n- Integration pattern: Auth.js credentials provider + JWT sessions, protected routes enforced via `src/middleware.ts`, and API writes guarded on the server as needed.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Auth route: `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`\n- Sign-in page: `src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\n- Route protection: `src/middleware.ts`\n- Feature components: `src/components/auth/` if shared UI is needed\n- Protected paths (minimum): `src/app/trips/`, `src/app/entries/` (creator management), `src/app/api/trips/`, `src/app/api/entries/`, `src/app/api/media/upload/`\n- Public paths (until share links exist): `src/app/entries/[id]/` entry reader, any read-only trip view routes (do not gate GET-only views)\n\n### Scope Boundaries\n\n- In scope: single creator sign-in, protected management routes, public shareable views.\n- Out of scope: multi-user admin flows, trip-level ACL, contributor permissions, password reset, MFA.\n\n### Completion Checklist\n\n- [x] Credentials provider works with `.env` values; invalid credentials show error.\n- [x] Unauthenticated access to management routes redirects to sign-in.\n- [x] Shareable trip/entry views remain accessible without sign-in.\n- [x] No new Prisma models or user tables introduced.\n- [x] Tests added under `tests/` for auth and route guards.\n\n### References\n\n- Epic 0 story details and ACs: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 0, Story 0.1)\n- Lightweight auth requirement (MVP scope): `_bmad-output/prd.md` (Functional Requirements: FR0)\n- Auth.js, JWT, and route conventions: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (Authentication & Security, API & Communication Patterns, Project Structure)\n- Viewer access without sign-in (anti-patterns to avoid): `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (Anti-Patterns to Avoid)\n- Global implementation rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Story created from epics, PRD, architecture, UX, and project-context inputs.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Implemented Auth.js credentials route, sign-in UI, and middleware gating with public entry/trip view exceptions.\n- Added test coverage for credential validation and middleware behavior (redirect + public access).\n- Tests: `npm run test`.\n- Hardened middleware to only allow explicit shareable trip routes and added server-side error messaging in auth flow.\n- Mapped Auth.js credential errors to clear sign-in messaging, including URL error handling.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/0-1-creator-sign-in-single-account.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/.env.example`\n- `travelblogs/package.json`\n- `travelblogs/package-lock.json`\n- `travelblogs/vitest.config.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/credentials.test.ts`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/middleware.test.ts`\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a developer,\nI want to initialize the project using the approved Next.js starter,\nso that the codebase matches the architecture decisions.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** a new workspace\n   **When** I run `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs` and select TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory\n   **Then** a new Next.js project is created with those options configured\n2. **Given** the new project is created\n   **When** I start the dev server\n   **Then** the application runs successfully and renders the default Next.js page\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Initialize Next.js app from starter (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Run `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs` from repo root\n  - [x] Select: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory\n  - [x] Ensure generated app lives at `travelblogs/` and does not overwrite `_bmad/` or `_bmad-output/`\n- [x] Verify dev server runs (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Start the dev server in the new app directory\n  - [x] Confirm the default Next.js page renders in the browser\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Primary objective is project initialization; avoid adding extra dependencies or features.\n- Use App Router only; project should include `src/app/` and Tailwind setup from the starter.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in the app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- Tests live under central `tests/` when added in later stories; no tests required for initial scaffold unless required by story.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Run the exact starter command from architecture: `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs`.\n- Select: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n- Ensure the generated app does not overwrite `_bmad/` or `_bmad-output/`.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes will live under `src/app/api` in later stories.\n- REST endpoints must be plural and use `{ data, error }` response wrapper when added later.\n- Naming and structure rules (camelCase vars, PascalCase components, kebab-case.tsx) apply when code is introduced.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js + TypeScript via create-next-app; do not introduce alternate starters.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 and Prisma 7.2.0 are required later; do not add them in this story.\n- Tailwind CSS must be included from starter selection.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Keep app under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory.\n- Do not modify `_bmad/` or `_bmad-output/` contents as part of initialization.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- No new tests required for scaffold-only story; later stories will add tests in `tests/`.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Expected base structure (post-init) aligns with architecture: `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/store`, `src/utils`, `tests/`, `prisma/`.\n- Keep REST routes under `src/app/api/` only when later stories add APIs.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.1)\n- Starter template decision: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (Starter Template Evaluation; Implementation Handoff)\n- Global standards: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Initialized Next.js app via create-next-app with TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and src/ directory.\n- Installed dependencies and verified dev server responded with HTTP 200 on localhost.\n- Added @babel/core as a dev dependency to satisfy eslint-config-next runtime requirement.\n- Added `.env` and `.env.example` and adjusted `.gitignore` to allow committing `.env.example`.\n- Expanded File List to include explicit scaffolded files for auditability.\n- Replaced default Next.js fonts/metadata with Fraunces + Source Serif 4 and TravelBlogs metadata.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-1-initialize-project-from-starter-template.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/.gitignore`\n- `travelblogs/.env`\n- `travelblogs/.env.example`\n- `travelblogs/README.md`\n- `travelblogs/eslint.config.mjs`\n- `travelblogs/next-env.d.ts`\n- `travelblogs/next.config.ts`\n- `travelblogs/package.json`\n- `travelblogs/package-lock.json`\n- `travelblogs/postcss.config.mjs`\n- `travelblogs/tsconfig.json`\n- `travelblogs/public/file.svg`\n- `travelblogs/public/globe.svg`\n- `travelblogs/public/next.svg`\n- `travelblogs/public/vercel.svg`\n- `travelblogs/public/window.svg`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/favicon.ico`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/globals.css`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/layout.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/page.tsx`\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to create a new trip with basic details,\nso that I can start organizing entries for that trip.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing the trips area\n   **When** I submit the create trip form with required fields (title, start date, end date)\n   **Then** a new trip is created and I am taken to the trip view\n   **And** the trip appears in my trip list\n2. **Given** I submit the create trip form with missing or invalid required fields\n   **When** I attempt to save\n   **Then** I see clear validation errors\n   **And** the trip is not created\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add Trip data model and persistence (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add Prisma (7.2.0) + SQLite setup if not already present\n  - [x] Define `Trip` model with required fields (`title`, `startDate`, `endDate`) and optional `coverImageUrl`\n  - [x] Include ownership field to associate trip with the creator account (Auth.js session user)\n  - [x] Run Prisma migration for new schema\n- [x] Implement create-trip API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add `POST /api/trips` route handler in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n  - [x] Validate request with Zod (server-side only)\n  - [x] Enforce creator auth + per-trip ACL rules\n  - [x] Return `{ data, error }` shape with ISO date strings\n- [x] Build create-trip UI and flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add create trip page (e.g., `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`)\n  - [x] Form fields: title, startDate, endDate (cover optional, not required)\n  - [x] On success, navigate to trip detail view (`/trips/:id`)\n  - [x] Surface inline validation errors and preserve user input on error\n- [x] Wire trip list refresh (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Ensure newly created trip appears in list state (reuse existing store or `src/utils/api.ts` helpers if present)\n  - [x] If trip list UI is not yet implemented, add a minimal list state update for later consumption\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Ensure API validation coverage: add tests under `tests/api/` for success + validation failures\n  - [x] If no test harness exists, create a minimal harness setup using Vitest + Testing Library and add the API tests (do not defer)\n  - [x] If component testing exists, add form validation test under `tests/components/`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- This story introduces the core Trip entity; keep scope limited to creation and validation.\n- Auth is already established in Epic 0; creation must be creator-only.\n- Use App Router route handlers and adhere strictly to response and naming conventions.\n- Regression guardrail: do not refactor or rename existing auth/session flows or shared utils; changes must be additive.\n- Performance guardrail: creation flow must be non-blocking with a visible loading state and no full-page reloads.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **Prisma/SQLite:** Use Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite. Add or update schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- **Trip model (minimum):** `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl?`, `ownerId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.\n- **Relationships:** Note expected future relations (`Trip` -> `Entry`, `Trip` -> `ShareLink`, `Trip` -> `TripAccess`) as comments in schema to avoid conflicts later.\n- **API:** `POST /api/trips` with Zod validation. Return `{ data, error }` and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session in API (`src/app/api/trips/route.ts`) and UI gate at `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`.\n- **Performance:** Show in-form loading/disabled submit while saving; avoid blocking navigation or rendering during submit.\n- **Data fetching pattern:** Use server components + `fetch` for initial page data and Redux only for client state (no RTK Query).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must be under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON; `PascalCase` components; `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Do not refactor existing auth/session files or shared utilities in this story.\n- Do not refactor shared `src/utils/api.ts` or Redux store setup (`src/store/index.ts`) if already present.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 for state if list state is introduced.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (POST) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for future detail routes.\n- UI: `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`, `src/components/trips/` for form components.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if state management is added/extended.\n- Utils: API helper in `src/utils/api.ts` if needed; avoid `lib/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add API tests in `tests/api/` for success + validation failures (required).\n- If no test harness exists, introduce a minimal harness using **Vitest + Testing Library** and add those API tests in this story (required).\n- Component tests in `tests/components/` if UI tests are already in place.\n- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Follow UX form patterns: labels above fields, inline validation, clear error text.\n- Primary action button only; use destructive styling only when needed.\n- Maintain minimum 44x44 touch targets and readable body size (17-18px).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- The app lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory from story 1.1.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.2)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (form patterns, accessibility)\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- No git commit history available for analysis (new repo).\n- Previous story context applied (App Router, app location, env rules).\n- Implemented Prisma SQLite setup with Trip model, migrations, and adapter-backed client.\n- Added create-trip API with Zod validation, creator auth, and ISO date responses.\n- Built trips list, create form, and trip detail pages with loading state and inline errors.\n- Code review fixes: session-based ownership, inline validation + disabled submit, date validation tests, and local DB ignore.\n- Tests: `npm test`, `npm run lint`.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/.env.example`\n- `travelblogs/.gitignore`\n- `travelblogs/package.json`\n- `travelblogs/package-lock.json`\n- `travelblogs/prisma.config.ts`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251221215929_init/migration.sql`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml`\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/db.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/trips/create-trip-form.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/trip-model.test.ts`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/create-trip.test.ts`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-21: Implemented trip creation flow with Prisma-backed API, UI pages, and tests.\n- 2025-12-21: Code review fixes for ownership scoping, inline validation, and date validation tests.\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [x] Prisma schema updated and migrated\n- [x] `POST /api/trips` implements validation + auth and returns `{ data, error }`\n- [x] Create-trip UI works end-to-end and navigates to trip detail\n- [x] Trip list reflects new trip\n- [x] Loading state shown during submit, no full-page reloads\n- [x] Tests added or TODO recorded if harness missing\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to delete a trip,\nso that I can remove trips I no longer want to keep.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I choose delete and confirm the action  \n   **Then** the trip is removed from my trip list  \n   **And** I can no longer access its entries\n2. **Given** I initiate delete and cancel the confirmation  \n   **When** I return to the trip view  \n   **Then** the trip remains unchanged\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add delete-trip API endpoint (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Implement `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [x] Require creator session and enforce ownership (per-trip ACL)\n  - [x] Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures\n  - [x] If related data exists (entries/share links), delete via cascade or transaction-safe cleanup\n- [x] Add delete flow in trip UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add a destructive \"Delete trip\" button on `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n  - [x] Show confirmation modal with clear cancel/confirm actions\n  - [x] On confirm, call delete API and redirect to `/trips`\n  - [x] On cancel, close modal with no data changes\n- [x] Update trip list state after deletion (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Ensure the deleted trip is removed from list state (Redux or local fetch revalidation)\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests under `tests/api/` for success, unauthorized, not-owner, not-found\n  - [x] Component test for confirmation modal behavior if component test harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation and list views are already implemented in Epic 1.2; deletion must integrate without refactors.\n- Deletion is creator-only; viewers should never see delete controls.\n- Ensure delete is a destructive action with a clear confirmation step (UX rule).\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes or auth/session utilities.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` using App Router route handlers.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session; verify ownership using session user id.\n- **Data:** Use Prisma to delete by id + ownerId; if related rows exist, delete in a transaction or rely on `onDelete: Cascade`.\n- **Error format:** `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` on failures (e.g., `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`).\n- **Dates:** If returned, serialize as ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Responses always wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests live under `tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for any request validation (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 if updating list state via store.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` (DELETE handler).\n- UI: `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx` plus `src/components/trips/` for any modal wrapper.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if list state updates are required.\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/delete-trip-modal.test.tsx` (if applicable).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found.\n- If a component test harness exists, validate modal confirm/cancel behavior.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Destructive action styling (clay red) with confirmation modal.\n- Cancel should be safe and primary action should be clearly labeled.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- App lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.3)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (destructive actions, modals, accessibility)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history unavailable (no commits yet).\n- Previous story intelligence applied from 1.2 (Trip model, API patterns, UI routes).\n- Implemented DELETE trip endpoint with auth, ownership checks, and standardized error responses.\n- Added delete trip modal and wired redirect to `/trips` after confirmation.\n- Added API delete-trip coverage; component test skipped because no component harness exists.\n- Tests run: `npx vitest run tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`, `npm test`.\n- Lint run: `npm run lint`.\n- Review fixes: added transaction-safe cleanup hooks, standardized 500 error response, and reset modal state on cancel/open.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-3-delete-trip.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/trips/delete-trip-modal.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-21: Implemented trip deletion API, UI confirmation modal, and API tests.\n- 2025-12-22: Review fixes for delete trip cleanup, error handling, and modal state.\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [ ] `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` implements auth + ownership checks\n- [ ] Trip delete confirmation modal works with cancel/confirm flows\n- [ ] Deleted trip no longer appears in list and is inaccessible\n- [ ] Tests added for API and UI as applicable\n"}}

(Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) for trips, entries, media, and sharing.\n+- **Analogical Thinking (creative):** Borrows proven patterns from adjacent domains (journaling apps, photo galleries, social feeds) to differentiate the travel blogging experience.\n+\n+**AI Rationale:** Start by clarifying the problem space and success signals (Question Storming), then generate structured feature variations (SCAMPER), and finish by importing winning patterns from related products (Analogical Thinking) to create a differentiated experience.\n*** End

Epic actively being worked on\\n#   - done: All stories in epic completed\\n#\\n# Epic Status Transitions:\\n#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)\\n#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status\\n#\\n# Story Status:\\n#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file\\n#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created

Retrospective Status:\\n#   - optional: Can be completed but not required\\n#   - done: Retrospective has been completed\\n#\\n# WORKFLOW NOTES:\\n# ===============\\n# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created\\n# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows\\n# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings\\n# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)\\n\\ngenerated: 2025-12-21T18:40:16Z\\nproject: TravelBlogs\\nproject_key:

reuse their auth, API response, and error patterns.\n    43\t- The trip detail page already renders metadata and uses owner checks; keep list links consistent with `/trips/:id`.\n    44\t- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes, auth helpers, or response utilities.\n    45\t- Performance guardrail: avoid loading full trip details; list should only fetch the fields needed for cards.\n    46\t\n    47\t### Technical Requirements\n    48\t\n    49\t- **API:** `GET /api/trips` in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` must return creator-owned trips only.\n    50\t- **Auth:** Use the same Auth.js session check as existing trip endpoints (`getToken` + creator validation).\n    51\t- **Data:** Return `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt` at minimum.\n    52\t- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n    53\t- **Ordering:** Preserve any existing ordering; if adding ordering, use `updatedAt` desc for most-recent-first and document it in code.\n    54\t- **Pagination:** If list size grows, add simple `limit`/`offset` (camelCase) with safe defaults (e.g., `limit=20`).\n    55\t- **Errors:** Always return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n    56\t\n    57\t### Architecture Compliance\n    58\t\n    59\t- App Router only; all API routes under `src/app/api`.\n    60\t- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n    61\t- Response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n    62\t- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n    63\t- Tests must live under `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n    64\t- Shared helpers live in `src/utils/`; do not add `lib/`.\n    65\t\n    66\t### Library/Framework Requirements\n    67\t\n    68\t- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n    69\t- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite for data access.\n    70\t- Zod 4.2.1 only if validation is needed (server-side only).\n    71\t- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n    72\t- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 only if existing list state pattern requires it; prefer server rendering.\n    73\t\n    74\t### File Structure Requirements\n    75\t\n    76\t- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (`GET` list) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for detail actions.\n    77\t- UI: `src/app/trips/page.tsx` plus `src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx` or `src/components/trips/trip-list.tsx`.\n    78\t- Utils: `src/utils/` for shared formatting helpers if required (avoid `lib/`).\n    79\t- Tests: `tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/trip-list.test.tsx` (if harness exists).\n    80\t\n    81\t### Testing Requirements\n    82\t\n    83\t- API tests: list success, unauthorized, and response shape assertions.\n    84\t- Component tests if harness exists: list renders metadata, empty state CTA visible when no trips.\n    85\t- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n    86\t\n    87\t### UX Requirements\n    88\t\n    89\t- Trip cards show cover image (if present), title, and date range in a scannable layout.\n    90\t- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for cover images.\n    91\t- Empty state includes a clear primary CTA to create a trip.\n    92\t- Empty state copy: “No trips yet. Create your first trip to start capturing your journey.”\n    93\t- Preserve existing visual language: ivory background, terracotta accents, teal primary, Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body.\n    94\t- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n    95\t\n    96\t### Previous Story Intelligence\n    97\t\n    98\t- Story 1.4 established `PATCH /api/trips/[id]` with creator-only auth, `{ data, error }` responses, and ISO 8601 dates.\n    99\t- Trip detail page already loads data server-side and uses owner checks; mirror that pattern for list rendering.\n   100\t- Validation and error handling patterns should match create/edit/delete trip endpoints to avoid regressions.\n   101\t\n   102\t### Cross-Story Dependencies\n   103\t\n   104\t- Relies on Story 1.2 (Create Trip) for Trip model fields and create flow.\n   105\t- Should align with Story 1.3/1.4 list refresh patterns and auth checks to avoid drift.\n   106\t\n   107\t### Data Model Notes\n   108\t\n   109\t- Trip model fields used by list: `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`, `ownerId`.\n   110\t- Ownership filter must use `ownerId` from Auth.js session to prevent cross-user data exposure.\n   111\t\n   112\t### Security Notes\n   113\t\n   114\t- List endpoint must be creator-only;
