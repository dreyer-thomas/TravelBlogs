Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to edit a trip's basic details,\nso that I can keep the trip information accurate.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I update trip metadata (title, dates, cover) and save  \n   **Then** the changes are persisted  \n   **And** the updated metadata appears in the trip view and trip list\n2. **Given** I submit invalid metadata (missing title or invalid dates)  \n   **When** I attempt to save  \n   **Then** I see clear validation errors  \n   **And** the changes are not saved\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add update-trip API endpoint (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Implement `PATCH /api/trips/[id]` in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Require creator session and enforce ownership (per-trip ACL)\n  - [ ] Validate title, startDate, endDate, coverImageUrl with Zod (match create-trip rules)\n  - [ ] Persist updates and return `{ data, error }` with ISO 8601 dates\n  - [ ] Return `{ error: { code, message } }` for `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`\n- [ ] Add edit flow in trip UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Provide an Edit action from the trip detail page (`src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`)\n  - [ ] Build edit form UI (new page or inline form) prefilled with current trip values\n  - [ ] Submit updates to `/api/trips/[id]`, show success and error states\n  - [ ] Redirect or re-render so the updated metadata is visible in detail + list views\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests under `tests/api/` for success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found, validation error\n  - [ ] Component test for edit form validation + submission if component test harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation (`POST /api/trips`) and deletion (`DELETE /api/trips/[id]`) already exist; follow their auth and response patterns.\n- Trip detail page already loads the trip server-side and renders metadata plus a delete modal.\n- Edit is creator-only; viewers should never see edit controls.\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes or auth/session utilities.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** Use App Router route handlers in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` with a `PATCH` handler.\n- **Auth:** `getToken` + creator check (`token.sub === \"creator\"`) consistent with create/delete.\n- **Validation:** Use Zod 4.2.1. Keep rules aligned with create-trip:\n  - `title`: non-empty string\n  - `startDate`, `endDate`: required ISO strings; `startDate <= endDate`\n  - `coverImageUrl`: optional string; allow empty string and trim to `undefined`\n- **Data:** Use Prisma to update by `id` + `ownerId`. Return ISO 8601 strings for dates.\n- **Errors:** Always return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` on failures.\n- **Dates:** JSON responses must use ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Responses always wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests live under `tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 only if existing state pattern requires it (prefer current server-rendered fetch flow).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` (add `PATCH`).\n- UI: `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx` (Edit CTA) + `src/app/trips/[id]/edit/page.tsx` or `src/components/trips/edit-trip-form.tsx`.\n- Utils (if needed): `src/utils/` (e.g., shared date formatting or validation helpers).\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/update-trip.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/edit-trip-form.test.tsx` (if applicable).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests: success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found, validation error.\n- Component test if harness exists: client-side validation, error messaging, submit success path.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` shapes.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Follow existing visual language (ivory background, terracotta accents, teal primary).\n- Inline validation with clear, human-friendly messaging.\n- Destructive actions remain red; edit actions are primary teal.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- App lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.4)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (forms, accessibility, color, typography)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-3-delete-trip.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history unavailable (no commits yet).\n\n### File List\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to edit a trip's basic details,\nso that I can keep the trip information accurate.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I update trip metadata (title, dates, cover) and save  \n   **Then** the changes are persisted  \n   **And** the updated metadata appears in the trip view and trip list\n2. **Given** I submit invalid metadata (missing title or invalid dates)  \n   **When** I attempt to save  \n   **Then** I see clear validation errors  \n   **And** the changes are not saved\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add update-trip API endpoint (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Implement `PATCH /api/trips/[id]` in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Require creator session and enforce ownership (per-trip ACL)\n  - [ ] Validate title, startDate, endDate, coverImageUrl with Zod (match create-trip rules)\n  - [ ] Persist updates and return `{ data, error }` with ISO 8601 dates\n  - [ ] Return `{ error: { code, message } }` for `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`\n- [ ] Add edit flow in trip UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Provide an Edit action from the trip detail page (`src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`)\n  - [ ] Build edit form UI (new page or inline form) prefilled with current trip values\n  - [ ] Submit updates to `/api/trips/[id]`, show success and error states\n  - [ ] Redirect or re-render so the updated metadata is visible in detail + list views\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests under `tests/api/` for success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found, validation error\n  - [ ] Component test for edit form validation + submission if component test harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation (`POST /api/trips`) and deletion (`DELETE /api/trips/[id]`) already exist; follow their auth and response patterns.\n- Trip detail page already loads the trip server-side and renders metadata plus a delete modal.\n- Edit is creator-only; viewers should never see edit controls.\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes or auth/session utilities.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** Use App Router route handlers in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` with a `PATCH` handler.\n- **Auth:** `getToken` + creator check (`token.sub === \"creator\"`) consistent with create/delete.\n- **Validation:** Use Zod 4.2.1. Keep rules aligned with create-trip:\n  - `title`: non-empty string\n  - `startDate`, `endDate`: required ISO strings; `startDate <= endDate`\n  - `coverImageUrl`: optional string; allow empty string and trim to `undefined`\n- **Data:** Use Prisma to update by `id` + `ownerId`. Return ISO 8601 strings for dates.\n- **Errors:** Always return `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` on failures.\n- **Dates:** JSON responses must use ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Responses always wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests live under `tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 only if existing state pattern requires it (prefer current server-rendered fetch flow).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` (add `PATCH`).\n- UI: `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx` (Edit CTA) + `src/app/trips/[id]/edit/page.tsx` or `src/components/trips/edit-trip-form.tsx`.\n- Utils (if needed): `src/utils/` (e.g., shared date formatting or validation helpers).\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/update-trip.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/edit-trip-form.test.tsx` (if applicable).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests: success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found, validation error.\n- Component test if harness exists: client-side validation, error messaging, submit success path.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` shapes.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Follow existing visual language (ivory background, terracotta accents, teal primary).\n- Inline validation with clear, human-friendly messaging.\n- Destructive actions remain red; edit actions are primary teal.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- App lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.4)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (forms, accessibility, color, typography)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-3-delete-trip.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history unavailable (no commits yet).\n\n### File List\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to delete a trip,\nso that I can remove trips I no longer want to keep.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I choose delete and confirm the action  \n   **Then** the trip is removed from my trip list  \n   **And** I can no longer access its entries\n2. **Given** I initiate delete and cancel the confirmation  \n   **When** I return to the trip view  \n   **Then** the trip remains unchanged\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add delete-trip API endpoint (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Implement `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [x] Require creator session and enforce ownership (per-trip ACL)\n  - [x] Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures\n  - [x] If related data exists (entries/share links), delete via cascade or transaction-safe cleanup\n- [x] Add delete flow in trip UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add a destructive \"Delete trip\" button on `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n  - [x] Show confirmation modal with clear cancel/confirm actions\n  - [x] On confirm, call delete API and redirect to `/trips`\n  - [x] On cancel, close modal with no data changes\n- [x] Update trip list state after deletion (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Ensure the deleted trip is removed from list state (Redux or local fetch revalidation)\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests under `tests/api/` for success, unauthorized, not-owner, not-found\n  - [x] Component test for confirmation modal behavior if component test harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation and list views are already implemented in Epic 1.2; deletion must integrate without refactors.\n- Deletion is creator-only; viewers should never see delete controls.\n- Ensure delete is a destructive action with a clear confirmation step (UX rule).\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes or auth/session utilities.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` using App Router route handlers.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session; verify ownership using session user id.\n- **Data:** Use Prisma to delete by id + ownerId; if related rows exist, delete in a transaction or rely on `onDelete: Cascade`.\n- **Error format:** `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` on failures (e.g., `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`).\n- **Dates:** If returned, serialize as ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Responses always wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests live under `tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for any request validation (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 if updating list state via store.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` (DELETE handler).\n- UI: `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx` plus `src/components/trips/` for any modal wrapper.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if list state updates are required.\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/delete-trip-modal.test.tsx` (if applicable).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found.\n- If a component test harness exists, validate modal confirm/cancel behavior.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Destructive action styling (clay red) with confirmation modal.\n- Cancel should be safe and primary action should be clearly labeled.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- App lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.3)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (destructive actions, modals, accessibility)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history unavailable (no commits yet).\n- Previous story intelligence applied from 1.2 (Trip model, API patterns, UI routes).\n- Implemented DELETE trip endpoint with auth, ownership checks, and standardized error responses.\n- Added delete trip modal and wired redirect to `/trips` after confirmation.\n- Added API delete-trip coverage; component test skipped because no component harness exists.\n- Tests run: `npx vitest run tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`, `npm test`.\n- Lint run: `npm run lint`.\n- Review fixes: added transaction-safe cleanup hooks, standardized 500 error response, and reset modal state on cancel/open.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-3-delete-trip.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/trips/delete-trip-modal.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-21: Implemented trip deletion API, UI confirmation modal, and API tests.\n- 2025-12-22: Review fixes for delete trip cleanup, error handling, and modal state.\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [ ] `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` implements auth + ownership checks\n- [ ] Trip delete confirmation modal works with cancel/confirm flows\n- [ ] Deleted trip no longer appears in list and is inaccessible\n- [ ] Tests added for API and UI as applicable\n"}}
