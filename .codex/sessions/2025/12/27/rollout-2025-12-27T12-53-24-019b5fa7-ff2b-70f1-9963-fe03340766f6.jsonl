Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to upload a cover image file for a trip,\nso that each trip feels visually distinct and easy to recognize.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator creating or editing a trip  \n   **When** I upload a valid image file (jpg/png/webp, <= 5MB) and save  \n   **Then** the image is stored and the trip shows the cover image in trip views\n2. **Given** I attempt to upload an invalid image file  \n   **When** I try to save  \n   **Then** I see a clear validation error  \n   **And** the trip is not saved with the invalid cover\n3. **Given** a trip already has a cover image  \n   **When** I upload a new cover image and save  \n   **Then** the cover image is replaced with the new file\n4. **Given** I am not authenticated as creator  \n   **When** I attempt to upload a cover image  \n   **Then** I receive an authorization error and nothing is stored\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Define cover upload constraints and API contract (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Allow only image MIME types (jpg/png/webp), max size 5MB\n  - [ ] Multipart field name: `file`; return `{ data: { url }, error: null }`\n- [ ] Implement media upload endpoint (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts` to accept multipart file upload\n  - [ ] Store file on NAS filesystem and return `{ data: { url }, error: null }`\n- [ ] Update trip create/edit API to accept uploaded cover (AC: 1, 3)\n  - [ ] `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Validate cover URL comes from upload endpoint\n- [ ] Update trip create/edit UI to upload file (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Add file input with preview\n  - [ ] Show upload progress and validation errors\n  - [ ] Use returned URL when submitting trip form\n- [ ] Update trip list/detail views to render cover image (AC: 1, 3)\n  - [ ] Use `next/image` and lazy loading\n  - [ ] Place cover in trip card thumbnail and trip detail header hero\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- File uploads store to NAS filesystem; do not introduce cloud storage for MVP. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points]\n- Use App Router API routes under `src/app/api`; responses must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Authentication: creator-only access for trip management endpoints. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for cover rendering. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Do not regress existing trip create/edit flows; replace the URL input with file upload and keep validation/error patterns consistent with current trip forms. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/create-trip-form.tsx]\n- Reuse existing `coverImageUrl` field on Trip; no new schema field is required. If schema is missing, add `coverImageUrl` as optional string. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Multipart parsing: avoid adding new dependencies unless required; if needed, use a minimal, well-maintained parser and document it in the API handler.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Media upload route lives at `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Trip UI components are in `src/components/trips/` with `kebab-case.tsx` files. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Shared helpers go in `src/utils/`; avoid adding `lib/`. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Code Quality & Style Rules]\n\n### References\n\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md#Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Accept image files only (jpg/png/webp), max size 5MB; reject invalid uploads with clear errors. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules]\n- Persist cover image URL on Trip records and render in trip list/detail views. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- API responses must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n - Upload endpoint must enforce creator auth and sanitize filenames/paths before writing to disk.\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use Next.js Image for cover rendering with lazy loading. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Store media on NAS filesystem; no Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Infrastructure & Deployment]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for creator-only access. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation of upload metadata and trip payloads. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Media upload API: `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Trip API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Trip components: `src/components/trips/` (file upload UI, preview, errors). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add API tests for upload success, invalid file type, and size limit failures. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add UI tests for upload validation and preview (if applicable). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, response formats, and test locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Cover image upload story created from user request.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- User provided story key: 1-6-trip-cover-image-upload\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- New story created outside epics list per user request.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-6-trip-cover-image-upload.md\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to upload a cover image file for a trip,\nso that each trip feels visually distinct and easy to recognize.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator creating or editing a trip  \n   **When** I upload a valid image file (jpg/png/webp, <= 5MB) and save  \n   **Then** the image is stored and the trip shows the cover image in trip views\n2. **Given** I attempt to upload an invalid image file  \n   **When** I try to save  \n   **Then** I see a clear validation error  \n   **And** the trip is not saved with the invalid cover\n3. **Given** a trip already has a cover image  \n   **When** I upload a new cover image and save  \n   **Then** the cover image is replaced with the new file\n4. **Given** I am not authenticated as creator  \n   **When** I attempt to upload a cover image  \n   **Then** I receive an authorization error and nothing is stored\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Define cover upload constraints and API contract (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Allow only image MIME types (jpg/png/webp), max size 5MB\n  - [ ] Multipart field name: `file`; return `{ data: { url }, error: null }`\n- [ ] Implement media upload endpoint (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts` to accept multipart file upload\n  - [ ] Store file on NAS filesystem and return `{ data: { url }, error: null }`\n- [ ] Update trip create/edit API to accept uploaded cover (AC: 1, 3)\n  - [ ] `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Validate cover URL comes from upload endpoint\n- [ ] Update trip create/edit UI to upload file (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Add file input with preview\n  - [ ] Show upload progress and validation errors\n  - [ ] Use returned URL when submitting trip form\n- [ ] Update trip list/detail views to render cover image (AC: 1, 3)\n  - [ ] Use `next/image` and lazy loading\n  - [ ] Place cover in trip card thumbnail and trip detail header hero\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- File uploads store to NAS filesystem; do not introduce cloud storage for MVP. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points]\n- Use App Router API routes under `src/app/api`; responses must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n- Authentication: creator-only access for trip management endpoints. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Use Next.js Image with lazy loading for cover rendering. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Do not regress existing trip create/edit flows; replace the URL input with file upload and keep validation/error patterns consistent with current trip forms. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/create-trip-form.tsx]\n- Reuse existing `coverImageUrl` field on Trip; no new schema field is required. If schema is missing, add `coverImageUrl` as optional string. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Multipart parsing: avoid adding new dependencies unless required; if needed, use a minimal, well-maintained parser and document it in the API handler.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Media upload route lives at `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Trip UI components are in `src/components/trips/` with `kebab-case.tsx` files. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Shared helpers go in `src/utils/`; avoid adding `lib/`. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Code Quality & Style Rules]\n\n### References\n\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Integration Points\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md#Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Accept image files only (jpg/png/webp), max size 5MB; reject invalid uploads with clear errors. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules]\n- Persist cover image URL on Trip records and render in trip list/detail views. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- API responses must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#API & Communication Patterns]\n - Upload endpoint must enforce creator auth and sanitize filenames/paths before writing to disk.\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes live under `src/app/api`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Use Next.js Image for cover rendering with lazy loading. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Store media on NAS filesystem; no Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Infrastructure & Deployment]\n\n## Library & Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for UI. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for creator-only access. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Authentication & Security]\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation of upload metadata and trip payloads. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Data Architecture]\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Media upload API: `src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Trip API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`. [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n- Trip components: `src/components/trips/` (file upload UI, preview, errors). [Source: _bmad-output/architecture.md#Project Structure & Boundaries]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Tests live in `tests/` only. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add API tests for upload success, invalid file type, and size limit failures. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n- Add UI tests for upload validation and preview (if applicable). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md#Testing Rules]\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` for naming, response formats, and test locations.\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to ready-for-dev.\n- Note: Cover image upload story created from user request.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- User provided story key: 1-6-trip-cover-image-upload\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- New story created outside epics list per user request.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-6-trip-cover-image-upload.md\n"}}
