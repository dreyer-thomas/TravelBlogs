Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to create a new trip with basic details,\nso that I can start organizing entries for that trip.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing the trips area\n   **When** I submit the create trip form with required fields (title, start date, end date)\n   **Then** a new trip is created and I am taken to the trip view\n   **And** the trip appears in my trip list\n2. **Given** I submit the create trip form with missing or invalid required fields\n   **When** I attempt to save\n   **Then** I see clear validation errors\n   **And** the trip is not created\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add Trip data model and persistence (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add Prisma (7.2.0) + SQLite setup if not already present\n  - [ ] Define `Trip` model with required fields (`title`, `startDate`, `endDate`) and optional `coverImageUrl`\n  - [ ] Include ownership field to associate trip with the creator account (Auth.js session user)\n  - [ ] Run Prisma migration for new schema\n- [ ] Implement create-trip API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `POST /api/trips` route handler in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Validate request with Zod (server-side only)\n  - [ ] Enforce creator auth + per-trip ACL rules\n  - [ ] Return `{ data, error }` shape with ISO date strings\n- [ ] Build create-trip UI and flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add create trip page (e.g., `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`)\n  - [ ] Form fields: title, startDate, endDate (cover optional, not required)\n  - [ ] On success, navigate to trip detail view (`/trips/:id`)\n  - [ ] Surface inline validation errors and preserve user input on error\n- [ ] Wire trip list refresh (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Ensure newly created trip appears in list state (reuse existing store or `src/utils/api.ts` helpers if present)\n  - [ ] If trip list UI is not yet implemented, add a minimal list state update for later consumption\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Ensure API validation coverage: add tests under `tests/api/` for success + validation failures\n  - [ ] If no test harness exists, create a minimal harness setup using Vitest + Testing Library and add the API tests (do not defer)\n  - [ ] If component testing exists, add form validation test under `tests/components/`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- This story introduces the core Trip entity; keep scope limited to creation and validation.\n- Auth is already established in Epic 0; creation must be creator-only.\n- Use App Router route handlers and adhere strictly to response and naming conventions.\n- Regression guardrail: do not refactor or rename existing auth/session flows or shared utils; changes must be additive.\n- Performance guardrail: creation flow must be non-blocking with a visible loading state and no full-page reloads.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **Prisma/SQLite:** Use Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite. Add or update schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- **Trip model (minimum):** `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl?`, `ownerId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.\n- **Relationships:** Note expected future relations (`Trip` -> `Entry`, `Trip` -> `ShareLink`, `Trip` -> `TripAccess`) as comments in schema to avoid conflicts later.\n- **API:** `POST /api/trips` with Zod validation. Return `{ data, error }` and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session in API (`src/app/api/trips/route.ts`) and UI gate at `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`.\n- **Performance:** Show in-form loading/disabled submit while saving; avoid blocking navigation or rendering during submit.\n- **Data fetching pattern:** Use server components + `fetch` for initial page data and Redux only for client state (no RTK Query).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must be under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON; `PascalCase` components; `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Do not refactor existing auth/session files or shared utilities in this story.\n- Do not refactor shared `src/utils/api.ts` or Redux store setup (`src/store/index.ts`) if already present.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 for state if list state is introduced.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (POST) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for future detail routes.\n- UI: `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`, `src/components/trips/` for form components.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if state management is added/extended.\n- Utils: API helper in `src/utils/api.ts` if needed; avoid `lib/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add API tests in `tests/api/` for success + validation failures (required).\n- If no test harness exists, introduce a minimal harness using **Vitest + Testing Library** and add those API tests in this story (required).\n- Component tests in `tests/components/` if UI tests are already in place.\n- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Follow UX form patterns: labels above fields, inline validation, clear error text.\n- Primary action button only; use destructive styling only when needed.\n- Maintain minimum 44x44 touch targets and readable body size (17-18px).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- The app lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory from story 1.1.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.2)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (form patterns, accessibility)\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- No git commit history available for analysis (new repo).\n- Previous story context applied (App Router, app location, env rules).\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [ ] Prisma schema updated and migrated\n- [ ] `POST /api/trips` implements validation + auth and returns `{ data, error }`\n- [ ] Create-trip UI works end-to-end and navigates to trip detail\n- [ ] Trip list reflects new trip\n- [ ] Loading state shown during submit, no full-page reloads\n- [ ] Tests added or TODO recorded if harness missing\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to create a new trip with basic details,\nso that I can start organizing entries for that trip.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing the trips area\n   **When** I submit the create trip form with required fields (title, start date, end date)\n   **Then** a new trip is created and I am taken to the trip view\n   **And** the trip appears in my trip list\n2. **Given** I submit the create trip form with missing or invalid required fields\n   **When** I attempt to save\n   **Then** I see clear validation errors\n   **And** the trip is not created\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add Trip data model and persistence (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add Prisma (7.2.0) + SQLite setup if not already present\n  - [ ] Define `Trip` model with required fields (`title`, `startDate`, `endDate`) and optional `coverImageUrl`\n  - [ ] Include ownership field to associate trip with the creator account (Auth.js session user)\n  - [ ] Run Prisma migration for new schema\n- [ ] Implement create-trip API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add `POST /api/trips` route handler in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Validate request with Zod (server-side only)\n  - [ ] Enforce creator auth + per-trip ACL rules\n  - [ ] Return `{ data, error }` shape with ISO date strings\n- [ ] Build create-trip UI and flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add create trip page (e.g., `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`)\n  - [ ] Form fields: title, startDate, endDate (cover optional, not required)\n  - [ ] On success, navigate to trip detail view (`/trips/:id`)\n  - [ ] Surface inline validation errors and preserve user input on error\n- [ ] Wire trip list refresh (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Ensure newly created trip appears in list state (reuse existing store or `src/utils/api.ts` helpers if present)\n  - [ ] If trip list UI is not yet implemented, add a minimal list state update for later consumption\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Ensure API validation coverage: add tests under `tests/api/` for success + validation failures\n  - [ ] If no test harness exists, create a minimal harness setup using Vitest + Testing Library and add the API tests (do not defer)\n  - [ ] If component testing exists, add form validation test under `tests/components/`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- This story introduces the core Trip entity; keep scope limited to creation and validation.\n- Auth is already established in Epic 0; creation must be creator-only.\n- Use App Router route handlers and adhere strictly to response and naming conventions.\n- Regression guardrail: do not refactor or rename existing auth/session flows or shared utils; changes must be additive.\n- Performance guardrail: creation flow must be non-blocking with a visible loading state and no full-page reloads.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **Prisma/SQLite:** Use Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite. Add or update schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- **Trip model (minimum):** `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl?`, `ownerId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.\n- **Relationships:** Note expected future relations (`Trip` -> `Entry`, `Trip` -> `ShareLink`, `Trip` -> `TripAccess`) as comments in schema to avoid conflicts later.\n- **API:** `POST /api/trips` with Zod validation. Return `{ data, error }` and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session in API (`src/app/api/trips/route.ts`) and UI gate at `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`.\n- **Performance:** Show in-form loading/disabled submit while saving; avoid blocking navigation or rendering during submit.\n- **Data fetching pattern:** Use server components + `fetch` for initial page data and Redux only for client state (no RTK Query).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must be under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON; `PascalCase` components; `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Do not refactor existing auth/session files or shared utilities in this story.\n- Do not refactor shared `src/utils/api.ts` or Redux store setup (`src/store/index.ts`) if already present.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 for state if list state is introduced.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (POST) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for future detail routes.\n- UI: `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`, `src/components/trips/` for form components.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if state management is added/extended.\n- Utils: API helper in `src/utils/api.ts` if needed; avoid `lib/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add API tests in `tests/api/` for success + validation failures (required).\n- If no test harness exists, introduce a minimal harness using **Vitest + Testing Library** and add those API tests in this story (required).\n- Component tests in `tests/components/` if UI tests are already in place.\n- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Follow UX form patterns: labels above fields, inline validation, clear error text.\n- Primary action button only; use destructive styling only when needed.\n- Maintain minimum 44x44 touch targets and readable body size (17-18px).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- The app lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory from story 1.1.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.2)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (form patterns, accessibility)\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- No git commit history available for analysis (new repo).\n- Previous story context applied (App Router, app location, env rules).\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [ ] Prisma schema updated and migrated\n- [ ] `POST /api/trips` implements validation + auth and returns `{ data, error }`\n- [ ] Create-trip UI works end-to-end and navigates to trip detail\n- [ ] Trip list reflects new trip\n- [ ] Loading state shown during submit, no full-page reloads\n- [ ] Tests added or TODO recorded if harness missing\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to create a new trip with basic details,\nso that I can start organizing entries for that trip.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing the trips area\n   **When** I submit the create trip form with required fields (title, start date, end date)\n   **Then** a new trip is created and I am taken to the trip view\n   **And** the trip appears in my trip list\n2. **Given** I submit the create trip form with missing or invalid required fields\n   **When** I attempt to save\n   **Then** I see clear validation errors\n   **And** the trip is not created\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add Trip data model and persistence (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add Prisma (7.2.0) + SQLite setup if not already present\n  - [x] Define `Trip` model with required fields (`title`, `startDate`, `endDate`) and optional `coverImageUrl`\n  - [x] Include ownership field to associate trip with the creator account (Auth.js session user)\n  - [x] Run Prisma migration for new schema\n- [x] Implement create-trip API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add `POST /api/trips` route handler in `src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n  - [x] Validate request with Zod (server-side only)\n  - [x] Enforce creator auth + per-trip ACL rules\n  - [x] Return `{ data, error }` shape with ISO date strings\n- [x] Build create-trip UI and flow (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add create trip page (e.g., `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`)\n  - [x] Form fields: title, startDate, endDate (cover optional, not required)\n  - [x] On success, navigate to trip detail view (`/trips/:id`)\n  - [x] Surface inline validation errors and preserve user input on error\n- [x] Wire trip list refresh (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Ensure newly created trip appears in list state (reuse existing store or `src/utils/api.ts` helpers if present)\n  - [x] If trip list UI is not yet implemented, add a minimal list state update for later consumption\n- [x] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Ensure API validation coverage: add tests under `tests/api/` for success + validation failures\n  - [x] If no test harness exists, create a minimal harness setup using Vitest + Testing Library and add the API tests (do not defer)\n  - [x] If component testing exists, add form validation test under `tests/components/`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- This story introduces the core Trip entity; keep scope limited to creation and validation.\n- Auth is already established in Epic 0; creation must be creator-only.\n- Use App Router route handlers and adhere strictly to response and naming conventions.\n- Regression guardrail: do not refactor or rename existing auth/session flows or shared utils; changes must be additive.\n- Performance guardrail: creation flow must be non-blocking with a visible loading state and no full-page reloads.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **Prisma/SQLite:** Use Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite. Add or update schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- **Trip model (minimum):** `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl?`, `ownerId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.\n- **Relationships:** Note expected future relations (`Trip` -> `Entry`, `Trip` -> `ShareLink`, `Trip` -> `TripAccess`) as comments in schema to avoid conflicts later.\n- **API:** `POST /api/trips` with Zod validation. Return `{ data, error }` and error format `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- **Dates:** Serialize all dates as ISO 8601 strings in JSON.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session in API (`src/app/api/trips/route.ts`) and UI gate at `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`.\n- **Performance:** Show in-form loading/disabled submit while saving; avoid blocking navigation or rendering during submit.\n- **Data fetching pattern:** Use server components + `fetch` for initial page data and Redux only for client state (no RTK Query).\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must be under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON; `PascalCase` components; `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests must live in `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Do not refactor existing auth/session files or shared utilities in this story.\n- Do not refactor shared `src/utils/api.ts` or Redux store setup (`src/store/index.ts`) if already present.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 for state if list state is introduced.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/route.ts` (POST) and `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` for future detail routes.\n- UI: `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`, `src/components/trips/` for form components.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if state management is added/extended.\n- Utils: API helper in `src/utils/api.ts` if needed; avoid `lib/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Add API tests in `tests/api/` for success + validation failures (required).\n- If no test harness exists, introduce a minimal harness using **Vitest + Testing Library** and add those API tests in this story (required).\n- Component tests in `tests/components/` if UI tests are already in place.\n- Ensure test expectations use `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Follow UX form patterns: labels above fields, inline validation, clear error text.\n- Primary action button only; use destructive styling only when needed.\n- Maintain minimum 44x44 touch targets and readable body size (17-18px).\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- The app lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory from story 1.1.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.2)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (form patterns, accessibility)\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- No git commit history available for analysis (new repo).\n- Previous story context applied (App Router, app location, env rules).\n- Implemented Prisma SQLite setup with Trip model, migrations, and adapter-backed client.\n- Added create-trip API with Zod validation, creator auth, and ISO date responses.\n- Built trips list, create form, and trip detail pages with loading state and inline errors.\n- Tests: `npm test`, `npm run lint`.\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`\n- `travelblogs/.env`\n- `travelblogs/.env.example`\n- `travelblogs/package.json`\n- `travelblogs/package-lock.json`\n- `travelblogs/prisma.config.ts`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/dev.db`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/test.db`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/migrations/20251221215929_init/migration.sql`\n- `travelblogs/prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml`\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/db.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/new/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/src/components/trips/create-trip-form.tsx`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/trip-model.test.ts`\n- `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/create-trip.test.ts`\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-21: Implemented trip creation flow with Prisma-backed API, UI pages, and tests.\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [ ] Prisma schema updated and migrated\n- [ ] `POST /api/trips` implements validation + auth and returns `{ data, error }`\n- [ ] Create-trip UI works end-to-end and navigates to trip detail\n- [ ] Trip list reflects new trip\n- [ ] Loading state shown during submit, no full-page reloads\n- [ ] Tests added or TODO recorded if harness missing\n"}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nWarm, human-readable pairing optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Fraunces` (expressive, travel-journal feel)\n- Body: `Source Serif 4` (highly readable long-form)\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative; CTA and title are focusable.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Keep latest entry preview under 2 lines.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap preview opens latest entry.\n\n### Timeline Entry Card\n\n**Purpose:** Enable fast scanning and navigation through the trip.  \n**Usage:** Timeline list and search results.  \n**Anatomy:** Thumbnail/media strip, title, date, location, short summary.  \n**States:** Default, hover, selected, unread/new.  \n**Variants:** Compact (list), rich (media-heavy).  \n**Accessibility:** Entire card is a link; ensure visible focus state.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Summary capped at 120 chars.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap to open entry detail.\n\n### Trip Switcher Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Switch between trips without confusion.  \n**Usage:** Global navigation.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip list with cover thumb, dates, last updated.  \n**States:** Default, selected, empty.  \n**Variants:** Drawer (mobile), popover (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation through list items.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting a trip returns to its latest entry.\n\n### Entry Reader\n\n**Purpose:** Long-form reading with immersive media.  \n**Usage:** Entry detail view.  \n**Anatomy:** Title, meta, media gallery, text body, map snippet.  \n**States:** Default, loading, error.  \n**Variants:** Read-only, contributor-editable.  \n**Accessibility:** Type size 17-18px minimum; skip-to-content.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Scrollable story, sticky top bar for navigation.\n\n### Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Keep spatial context while browsing entries.  \n**Usage:** Trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Map with pins + timeline list.  \n**States:** Default, selected pin, no location data.  \n**Variants:** Side-by-side (desktop), stacked (mobile).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard pin navigation; map has list alternative.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting pin highlights timeline entry.\n\n### Share/Invite Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Enable viewer access without friction.  \n**Usage:** Trip settings/share.  \n**Anatomy:** Share link, copy button, invite fields (optional).  \n**States:** Default, copied, error.  \n**Variants:** Minimal (link only), full (invite list).  \n**Accessibility:** Clear labels and focus feedback.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Copy link shows success state.\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Build custom components on top of design system tokens.\n- Keep core controls consistent with system defaults.\n- Prioritize accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation).\n- Use shared layout primitives for spacing consistency.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (Core Journeys):**\n- Active Trip Hero\n- Timeline Entry Card\n- Entry Reader\n\n**Phase 2 (Navigation + Context):**\n- Trip Switcher Panel\n- Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Phase 3 (Sharing):**\n- Share/Invite Panel\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**When to Use:** Primary for the single most important action; secondary for supportive actions; destructive only when necessary.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Primary: Teal filled buttons  \n- Secondary: Ghost style (text + subtle hover)  \n- Destructive: Clay red with clear label  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Only one primary action per view  \n- Destructive actions require confirm modal  \n**Accessibility:** Clear focus states and minimum 44px touch targets  \n**Mobile Considerations:** Primary action anchored near thumb-reach when possible\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Trip creation, entry creation/editing, sharing.  \n**Visual Design:** Labels above fields with asterisk for required fields.  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Inline validation as users type  \n- Errors appear below field with gentle, human language  \n- Submit disabled until required fields are valid  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Associate labels/inputs  \n- Error text announced by screen readers  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Large tap targets and clear spacing between inputs\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Global navigation, trip switching, entry browsing.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Desktop: Sidebar navigation with hamburger menu  \n- Mobile: Bottom button bar for primary sections  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Latest entry is visible on entry, but no persistent CTA  \n- Trips are always accessible via the nav  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Keyboard support for sidebar menu  \n- Clear active state indicator  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Bottom bar stays visible during scrolling\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop:** Map + timeline side-by-side for maximum context.\n- **Tablet:** Stacked layout (map above timeline) to keep reading simple.\n- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with bottom navigation for primary sections.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- **Mobile:** <768px  \n- **Tablet:** 768-1023px  \n- **Desktop:** 1024px+\n\nMobile-first layout with progressive enhancement for larger screens.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- Target **WCAG AA** compliance.\n- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.\n- Visible focus states for all interactive elements.\n- Minimum 44x44px touch targets.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Basic accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast checks.\n- Responsive device checks across mobile/tablet/desktop in major browsers.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary.\n- Support keyboard navigation for menus and drawers.\n- Keep line lengths and spacing optimized for readability.\n- Avoid hover-only interactions; ensure touch parity.\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
