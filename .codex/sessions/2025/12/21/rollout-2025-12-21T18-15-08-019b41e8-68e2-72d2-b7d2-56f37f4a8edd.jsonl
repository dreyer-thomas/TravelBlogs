Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{output_folder}/architecture.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery:\n\n**PRD Document (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/*prd*.md`\n2. If no main files: Check for sharded PRD folder: `{output_folder}/*prd*/**/*.md`\n3. If sharded folder exists: Load EVERY file in that folder completely\n4. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Epics/Stories Document (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/*epic*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*epic*.md`\n3. If no main files: Check for sharded epics folder: `{output_folder}/*epic*/**/*.md`\n4. If sharded folder exists: Load EVERY file in that folder completely\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**UX Design Specification (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check folder: `{output_folder}/*ux*.md`\n2. If no main files: Check for sharded UX folder: `{output_folder}/*ux*/**/*.md`\n3. If sharded folder exists: Load EVERY file in that folder completely\n4. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Research Documents (Priority: Analysis → Main):**\n\n1. Check folder: `{output_folder}/research/*research*.md`\n2. If no files: Try folder: `{output_folder}/*research*.md`\n3. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Project Documentation (Existing Projects):**\n\n1. Look for index file: `{output_folder/index.md`\n2. CRITICAL: Load index.md to understand what project files are available\n3. Read available files from index to understand existing project context\n4. This provides essential context for extending existing project with new architecture\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Project Context Rules (Critical for AI Agents):**\n\n1. Check for project context file: `**/project-context.md`\n2. If exists: Load COMPLETE file contents - this contains critical rules for AI agents\n3. Add to frontmatter `hasProjectContext: true` and track file path\n4. Report to user: \"Found existing project context with {number_of_rules} agent rules\"\n5. This file contains language-specific patterns, testing rules, and implementation guidelines that must be followed\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely (no offset/limit)\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture\n- For existing projects, use index.md as guide to what's relevant\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Validate Required Inputs\n\nBefore proceeding, verify we have the essential inputs:\n\n**PRD Validation:**\n\n- If no PRD found: \"Architecture requires a PRD to work from. Please run the PRD workflow first or provide the PRD file path.\"\n- Do NOT proceed without PRD\n\n**Other Inputs:**\n\n- UX Spec: \"Provides UI/UX architectural requirements\" (Optional)\n\n#### C. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/architecture-decision-template.md` to `{output_folder}/architecture.md`\nInitialize frontmatter with:\n\n```yaml\n---\nstepsCompleted: []\ninputDocuments: []\nworkflowType: 'architecture'\nlastStep: 0\nproject_name: '{{project_name}}'\nuser_name: '{{user_name}}'\ndate: '{{date}}'\n---\n```\n\n#### D. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{output_folder}/architecture.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your Architecture workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found - REQUIRED\"}\n- Epics/Stories: {number of epic files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- UX Design: {number of UX files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Research: {number of research files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project docs: {number of project files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project context: {project_context_rules count of rules for AI agents found}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nReady to begin architectural decision making. Do you have any other documents you'd like me to include?\n\n[C] Continue to project context analysis\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ PRD requirement validated and communicated\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n❌ Proceeding without validating PRD requirement\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, load `./step-02-context.md` to analyze the project context and begin architectural decision making.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until user explicitly selects [C] from the menu and setup is confirmed!\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR1: Admin can create user accounts.

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nWarm, human-readable pairing optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Fraunces` (expressive, travel-journal feel)\n- Body: `Source Serif 4` (highly readable long-form)\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative; CTA and title are focusable.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Keep latest entry preview under 2 lines.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap preview opens latest entry.\n\n### Timeline Entry Card\n\n**Purpose:** Enable fast scanning and navigation through the trip.  \n**Usage:** Timeline list and search results.  \n**Anatomy:** Thumbnail/media strip, title, date, location, short summary.  \n**States:** Default, hover, selected, unread/new.  \n**Variants:** Compact (list), rich (media-heavy).  \n**Accessibility:** Entire card is a link; ensure visible focus state.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Summary capped at 120 chars.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap to open entry detail.\n\n### Trip Switcher Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Switch between trips without confusion.  \n**Usage:** Global navigation.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip list with cover thumb, dates, last updated.  \n**States:** Default, selected, empty.  \n**Variants:** Drawer (mobile), popover (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation through list items.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting a trip returns to its latest entry.\n\n### Entry Reader\n\n**Purpose:** Long-form reading with immersive media.  \n**Usage:** Entry detail view.  \n**Anatomy:** Title, meta, media gallery, text body, map snippet.  \n**States:** Default, loading, error.  \n**Variants:** Read-only, contributor-editable.  \n**Accessibility:** Type size 17-18px minimum; skip-to-content.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Scrollable story, sticky top bar for navigation.\n\n### Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Keep spatial context while browsing entries.  \n**Usage:** Trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Map with pins + timeline list.  \n**States:** Default, selected pin, no location data.  \n**Variants:** Side-by-side (desktop), stacked (mobile).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard pin navigation; map has list alternative.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting pin highlights timeline entry.\n\n### Share/Invite Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Enable viewer access without friction.  \n**Usage:** Trip settings/share.  \n**Anatomy:** Share link, copy button, invite fields (optional).  \n**States:** Default, copied, error.  \n**Variants:** Minimal (link only), full (invite list).  \n**Accessibility:** Clear labels and focus feedback.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Copy link shows success state.\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Build custom components on top of design system tokens.\n- Keep core controls consistent with system defaults.\n- Prioritize accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation).\n- Use shared layout primitives for spacing consistency.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (Core Journeys):**\n- Active Trip Hero\n- Timeline Entry Card\n- Entry Reader\n\n**Phase 2 (Navigation + Context):**\n- Trip Switcher Panel\n- Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Phase 3 (Sharing):**\n- Share/Invite Panel\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**When to Use:** Primary for the single most important action; secondary for supportive actions; destructive only when necessary.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Primary: Teal filled buttons  \n- Secondary: Ghost style (text + subtle hover)  \n- Destructive: Clay red with clear label  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Only one primary action per view  \n- Destructive actions require confirm modal  \n**Accessibility:** Clear focus states and minimum 44px touch targets  \n**Mobile Considerations:** Primary action anchored near thumb-reach when possible\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Trip creation, entry creation/editing, sharing.  \n**Visual Design:** Labels above fields with asterisk for required fields.  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Inline validation as users type  \n- Errors appear below field with gentle, human language  \n- Submit disabled until required fields are valid  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Associate labels/inputs  \n- Error text announced by screen readers  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Large tap targets and clear spacing between inputs\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Global navigation, trip switching, entry browsing.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Desktop: Sidebar navigation with hamburger menu  \n- Mobile: Bottom button bar for primary sections  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Latest entry is visible on entry, but no persistent CTA  \n- Trips are always accessible via the nav  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Keyboard support for sidebar menu  \n- Clear active state indicator  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Bottom bar stays visible during scrolling\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop:** Map + timeline side-by-side for maximum context.\n- **Tablet:** Stacked layout (map above timeline) to keep reading simple.\n- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with bottom navigation for primary sections.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- **Mobile:** <768px  \n- **Tablet:** 768-1023px  \n- **Desktop:** 1024px+\n\nMobile-first layout with progressive enhancement for larger screens.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- Target **WCAG AA** compliance.\n- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.\n- Visible focus states for all interactive elements.\n- Minimum 44x44px touch targets.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Basic accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast checks.\n- Responsive device checks across mobile/tablet/desktop in major browsers.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary.\n- Support keyboard navigation for menus and drawers.\n- Keep line lengths and spacing optimized for readability.\n- Avoid hover-only interactions;

Review Project Requirements\n\n**From PRD Analysis:**\n\n- Extract and analyze Functional Requirements (FRs)\n- Identify Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) like performance, security, compliance\n- Note any technical constraints or dependencies mentioned\n- Count and categorize requirements to understand project scale\n\n**From Epics/Stories (if available):**\n\n- Map epic structure and user stories to architectural components\n- Extract acceptance criteria for technical implications\n- Identify cross-cutting concerns that span multiple epics\n- Estimate story complexity for architectural planning\n\n**From UX Design (if available):**\n\n- Extract architectural implications from UX requirements:\n  - Component complexity (simple forms vs rich interactions)\n  - Animation/transition requirements\n  - Real-time update needs (live data, collaborative features)\n  - Platform-specific UI requirements\n  - Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance level)\n  - Responsive design breakpoints\n  - Offline capability requirements\n  - Performance expectations (load times, interaction responsiveness)\n\n### 2. Project Scale Assessment\n\nCalculate and present project complexity:\n\n**Complexity Indicators:**\n\n- Real-time features requirements\n- Multi-tenancy needs\n- Regulatory compliance requirements\n- Integration complexity\n- User interaction complexity\n- Data complexity and volume\n\n### 3. Reflect Understanding\n\nPresent your analysis back to user for validation:\n\n\"I'm reviewing your project documentation for {{project_name}}.\n\n{if_epics_loaded}I see {{epic_count}} epics with {{story_count}} total stories.{/if_epics_loaded}\n{if_no_epics}I found {{fr_count}} functional requirements organized into {{fr_category_list}}.{/if_no_epics}\n{if_ux_loaded}I also found your UX specification which defines the user experience requirements.{/if_ux_loaded}\n\n**Key architectural aspects I notice:**\n\n- [Summarize core functionality from FRs]\n- [Note critical NFRs that will shape architecture]\n- {if_ux_loaded}[Note UX complexity and technical requirements]{/if_ux_loaded}\n- [Identify unique technical challenges or constraints]\n- [Highlight any regulatory or compliance requirements]\n\n**Scale indicators:**\n\n- Project complexity appears to be: [low/medium/high/enterprise]\n- Primary technical domain: [web/mobile/api/backend/full-stack/etc]\n- Cross-cutting concerns identified: [list major ones]\n\nThis analysis will help me guide you through the architectural decisions needed to ensure AI agents implement this consistently.\n\nDoes this match your understanding of the project scope and requirements?\"\n\n### 4.

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n+\n+## Project Context Analysis\n+\n+### Requirements Overview\n+\n+**Functional Requirements:**\n+The MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n+\n+**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n+Performance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n+\n+**Scale & Complexity:**\n+Low complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n+\n+- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n+- Complexity level: low\n+- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n+\n+### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n+\n+- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n+- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n+- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n+- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n+\n+### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n+\n+- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n+- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n+- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n+- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n*** End Patch"}}

Check Technical Preferences & Context\n\n**Check Project Context for Existing Technical Preferences:**\n\"Before we dive into starter templates, let me check if you have any technical preferences already documented.\n\n{{if_project_context_exists}}\nI found some technical rules in your project context file:\n{{extracted_technical_preferences_from_project_context}}\n\n**Project Context Technical Rules Found:**\n\n- Languages/Frameworks: {{languages_frameworks_from_context}}\n- Tools & Libraries: {{tools_from_context}}\n- Development Patterns: {{patterns_from_context}}\n- Platform Preferences: {{platforms_from_context}}\n\n{{else}}\nNo existing technical preferences found in project context file. We'll establish your technical preferences now.\n{{/if_project_context}}\"\n\n**Discover User Technical Preferences:**\n\"Based on your project context, let's discuss your technical preferences:\n\n{{primary_technology_category}} Preferences:\n\n- **Languages**: Do you have preferences between TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.?\n- **Frameworks**: Any existing familiarity or preferences (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, etc.)?\n- **Databases**: Any preferences or existing infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)?\n\n**Development Experience:**\n\n- What's your team's experience level with different technologies?\n- Are there any technologies you want to learn vs. what you're comfortable with?\n\n**Platform/Deployment Preferences:**\n\n- Cloud provider preferences (AWS, Vercel, Railway, etc.)?\n- Container preferences (Docker, Serverless, Traditional)?\n\n**Integrations:**\n\n- Any existing systems or APIs you need to integrate with?\n- Third-party services you plan to use (payment, authentication, analytics, etc.)?\n\nThese preferences will help me recommend the most suitable starter templates and guide our architectural decisions.\"\n\n### 1. Identify Primary Technology Domain\n\nBased on project context analysis and technical preferences, identify the primary technology stack:\n\n- **Web application** → Look for Next.js, Vite, Remix, SvelteKit starters\n- **Mobile app** → Look for React Native, Expo, Flutter starters\n- **API/Backend** → Look for NestJS, Express, Fastify, Supabase starters\n- **CLI tool** → Look for CLI framework starters (oclif, commander, etc.)\n- **Full-stack** → Look for T3, RedwoodJS, Blitz, Next.js starters\n- **Desktop** → Look for Electron, Tauri starters\n\n### 2. UX Requirements Consideration\n\nIf UX specification was loaded, consider UX requirements when selecting starter:\n\n- **Rich animations** → Framer Motion compatible starter\n- **Complex forms** → React Hook Form included starter\n- **Real-time features** → Socket.io or WebSocket ready starter\n- **Design system** → Storybook-enabled starter\n- **Offline capability** → Service worker or PWA configured starter\n\n### 3. Research Current Starter Options\n\nSearch the web to find current, maintained starter templates:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} starter template CLI create command latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} boilerplate generator latest options\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} production-ready starter best practices\"\n```\n\n### 4. Investigate Top Starter Options\n\nFor each promising starter found, investigate details:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} default setup technologies included latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} project structure file organization\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} production deployment capabilities\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} recent updates maintenance status\"\n```\n\n### 5. Analyze What Each Starter Provides\n\nFor each viable starter option, document:\n\n**Technology Decisions Made:**\n\n- Language/TypeScript configuration\n- Styling solution (CSS, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)\n- Testing framework setup\n- Linting/Formatting configuration\n- Build tooling and optimization\n- Project structure and organization\n\n**Architectural Patterns Established:**\n\n- Code organization patterns\n- Component structure conventions\n- API layering approach\n- State management setup\n- Routing patterns\n- Environment configuration\n\n**Development Experience Features:**\n\n- Hot reloading and development server\n- TypeScript configuration\n- Debugging setup\n- Testing infrastructure\n- Documentation generation\n\n### 6. Present Starter Options\n\nBased on user skill level and project needs:\n\n**For Expert Users:**\n\"Found {{starter_name}} which provides:\n{{quick_decision_list_of_key_decisions}}\n\nThis would establish our base architecture with these technical decisions already made. Use it?\"\n\n**For Intermediate Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is a well-maintained starter for {{project_type}} projects.\n\nIt makes these architectural decisions for us:\n{{decision_list_with_explanations}}\n\nThis gives us a solid foundation following current best practices. Should we use it?\"\n\n**For Beginner Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is like a pre-built foundation for your project.\n\nThink of it like buying a prefab house frame instead of cutting each board yourself.\n\nIt makes these decisions for us:\n{{friendly_explanation_of_decisions}}\n\nThis is a great starting point that follows best practices and saves us from making dozens of small technical choices. Should we use it?\"\n\n### 7. Get Current CLI Commands\n\nIf user shows interest in a starter, get the exact current commands:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} CLI command options flags latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} create new project command examples\"\n```\n\n### 8. Generate Starter Template Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n````markdown\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\n{{identified_domain}} based on project requirements analysis\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n{{analysis_of_evaluated_starters}}\n\n### Selected Starter: {{starter_name}}\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\n{{why_this_starter_was_chosen}}\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\n{{full_starter_command_with_options}}\n```\n````\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\n{{language_typescript_setup}}\n\n**Styling Solution:**\n{{styling_solution_configuration}}\n\n**Build Tooling:**\n{{build_tools_and_optimization}}\n\n**Testing Framework:**\n{{testing_setup_and_configuration}}\n\n**Code Organization:**\n{{project_structure_and_patterns}}\n\n**Development Experience:**\n{{development_tools_and_workflow}}\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n```\n\n### 9. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated content and present choices:\n\n\"I've analyzed starter template options for {{project_type}} projects.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 8]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore custom approaches or unconventional starters\n[P] Party Mode - Evaluate trade-offs from different perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save this decision and move to architectural decisions\"\n\n### 10. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with current starter analysis\n- Process enhanced insights about starter options or custom approaches\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the starter template evaluation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with starter evaluation context\n- Process collaborative insights about starter trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the starter template evaluation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`\n- Load `./step-04-decisions.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 8.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Primary technology domain correctly identified from project context\n✅ Current, maintained starter templates researched and evaluated\n✅ All versions verified using web search, not hardcoded\n✅ Architectural implications of starter choice clearly documented\n✅ User provided with clear rationale for starter selection\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not verifying current versions with web search\n❌ Ignoring UX requirements when evaluating starters\n❌ Not documenting what architectural decisions the starter makes\n❌ Failing to consider maintenance status of starter templates\n❌ Not providing clear rationale for starter selection\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-decisions.md` to begin making specific architectural decisions.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-04 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n```\n"}}

Load Decision Framework & Check Existing Preferences\n\n**Review Technical Preferences from Step 3:**\n\"Based on our technical preferences discussion in step 3, let's build on those foundations:\n\n**Your Technical Preferences:**\n{{user_technical_preferences_from_step_3}}\n\n**Starter Template Decisions:**\n{{starter_template_decisions}}\n\n**Project Context Technical Rules:**\n{{project_context_technical_rules}}\"\n\n**Identify Remaining Decisions:**\nBased on technical preferences, starter template choice, and project context, identify remaining critical decisions:\n\n**Already Decided (Don't re-decide these):**\n\n- {{starter_template_decisions}}\n- {{user_technology_preferences}}\n- {{project_context_technical_rules}}\n\n**Critical Decisions:** Must be decided before implementation can proceed\n**Important Decisions:** Shape the architecture significantly\n**Nice-to-Have:** Can be deferred if needed\n\n### 2. Decision Categories by Priority\n\n#### Category 1: Data Architecture\n\n- Database choice (if not determined by starter)\n- Data modeling approach\n- Data validation strategy\n- Migration approach\n- Caching strategy\n\n#### Category 2: Authentication & Security\n\n- Authentication method\n- Authorization patterns\n- Security middleware\n- Data encryption approach\n- API security strategy\n\n#### Category 3: API & Communication\n\n- API design patterns (REST, GraphQL, etc.)\n- API documentation approach\n- Error handling standards\n- Rate limiting strategy\n- Communication between services\n\n#### Category 4: Frontend Architecture (if applicable)\n\n- State management approach\n- Component architecture\n- Routing strategy\n- Performance optimization\n- Bundle optimization\n\n#### Category 5: Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- Hosting strategy\n- CI/CD pipeline approach\n- Environment configuration\n- Monitoring and logging\n- Scaling strategy\n\n### 3. Facilitate Each Decision Category\n\nFor each category, facilitate collaborative decision making:\n\n**Present the Decision:**\nBased on user skill level and project context:\n\n**Expert Mode:**\n\"{{Decision_Category}}: {{Specific_Decision}}\n\nOptions: {{concise_option_list_with_tradeoffs}}\n\nWhat's your preference for this decision?\"\n\n**Intermediate Mode:**\n\"Next decision: {{Human_Friendly_Category}}\n\nWe need to choose {{Specific_Decision}}.\n\nCommon options:\n{{option_list_with_brief_explanations}}\n\nFor your project, I'd lean toward {{recommendation}} because {{reason}}. What are your thoughts?\"\n\n**Beginner Mode:**\n\"Let's talk about {{Human_Friendly_Category}}.\n\n{{Educational_Context_About_Why_This_Matters}}\n\nThink of it like {{real_world_analogy}}.\n\nYour main options:\n{{friendly_options_with_pros_cons}}\n\nMy suggestion: {{recommendation}}\nThis is good for you because {{beginner_friendly_reason}}.\n\nWhat feels right to you?\"\n\n**Verify Technology Versions:**\nIf decision involves specific technology:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{technology}} latest stable version\"\nSearch the web: \"{{technology}} current LTS version\"\nSearch the web: \"{{technology}} production readiness\"\n```\n\n**Get User Input:**\n\"What's your preference? (or 'explain more' for details)\"\n\n**Handle User Response:**\n\n- If user wants more info: Provide deeper explanation\n- If user has preference: Discuss implications and record decision\n- If user wants alternatives: Explore other options\n\n**Record the Decision:**\n\n- Category: {{category}}\n- Decision: {{user_choice}}\n- Version: {{verified_version_if_applicable}}\n- Rationale: {{user_reasoning_or_default}}\n- Affects: {{components_or_epics}}\n- Provided by Starter: {{yes_if_from_starter}}\n\n### 4. Check for Cascading Implications\n\nAfter each major decision, identify related decisions:\n\n\"This choice means we'll also need to decide:\n\n- {{related_decision_1}}\n- {{related_decision_2}}\"\n\n### 5. Generate Decisions Content\n\nAfter facilitating all decision categories, prepare the content to append:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n{{critical_decisions_made}}\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n{{important_decisions_made}}\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n{{decisions_deferred_with_rationale}}\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n{{data_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n{{security_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n{{api_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n{{frontend_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n{{infrastructure_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n{{ordered_list_of_decisions_for_implementation}}\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n{{how_decisions_affect_each_other}}\n```\n\n### 6. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated decisions content and present choices:\n\n\"I've documented all the core architectural decisions we've made together.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 5]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore innovative approaches to any specific decisions\n[P] Party Mode - Review decisions from multiple perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save these decisions and move to implementation patterns\"\n\n### 7. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with specific decision categories\n- Process enhanced insights about particular decisions\n- Ask user: \"Accept these enhancements to the architectural decisions? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with architectural decisions context\n- Process collaborative insights about decision trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the architectural decisions? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n- Load `./step-05-patterns.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All critical architectural decisions made collaboratively\n✅ Technology versions verified using web search\n✅ Decision rationale clearly documented\n✅ Cascading implications identified and addressed\n✅ User provided appropriate level of explanation for skill level\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly for each category\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Making recommendations instead of facilitating decisions\n❌ Not verifying technology versions with web search\n❌ Missing cascading implications between decisions\n❌ Not adapting explanations to user skill level\n❌ Forgetting to document decisions made by starter template\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-patterns.md` to define implementation patterns that ensure consistency across AI agents.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Analyze Requirements Mapping\n\nMap project requirements to architectural components:\n\n**From Epics (if available):**\n\"Epic: {{epic_name}} → Lives in {{module/directory/service}}\"\n\n- User stories within the epic\n- Cross-epic dependencies\n- Shared components needed\n\n**From FR Categories (if no epics):**\n\"FR Category: {{fr_category_name}} → Lives in {{module/directory/service}}\"\n\n- Related functional requirements\n- Shared functionality across categories\n- Integration points between categories\n\n### 2. Define Project Directory Structure\n\nBased on technology stack and patterns, create the complete project structure:\n\n**Root Configuration Files:**\n\n- Package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)\n- Build and development configuration\n- Environment configuration files\n- CI/CD pipeline files\n- Documentation files\n\n**Source Code Organization:**\n\n- Application entry points\n- Core application structure\n- Feature/module organization\n- Shared utilities and libraries\n- Configuration and environment files\n\n**Test Organization:**\n\n- Unit test locations and structure\n- Integration test organization\n- End-to-end test structure\n- Test utilities and fixtures\n\n**Build and Distribution:**\n\n- Build output directories\n- Distribution files\n- Static assets\n- Documentation build\n\n### 3. Define Integration Boundaries\n\nMap how components communicate and where boundaries exist:\n\n**API Boundaries:**\n\n- External API endpoints\n- Internal service boundaries\n- Authentication and authorization boundaries\n- Data access layer boundaries\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n\n- Frontend component communication patterns\n- State management boundaries\n- Service communication patterns\n- Event-driven integration points\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n\n- Database schema boundaries\n- Data access patterns\n- Caching boundaries\n- External data integration points\n\n### 4. Create Complete Project Tree\n\nGenerate a comprehensive directory structure showing all files and directories:\n\n**Technology-Specific Structure Examples:**\n\n**Next.js Full-Stack:**\n\n```\nproject-name/\n├── README.md\n├── package.json\n├── next.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.js\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── .env.local\n├── .env.example\n├── .gitignore\n├── .github/\n│   └── workflows/\n│       └── ci.yml\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/\n│   │   ├── globals.css\n│   │   ├── layout.tsx\n│   │   └── page.tsx\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   ├── forms/\n│   │   └── features/\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   ├── db.ts\n│   │   ├── auth.ts\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── types/\n│   └── middleware.ts\n├── prisma/\n│   ├── schema.prisma\n│   └── migrations/\n├── tests/\n│   ├── __mocks__/\n│   ├── components/\n│   └── e2e/\n└── public/\n    └── assets/\n```\n\n**API Backend (NestJS):**\n\n```\nproject-name/\n├── package.json\n├── nest-cli.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── .env\n├── .env.example\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.ts\n│   ├── app.module.ts\n│   ├── config/\n│   ├── modules/\n│   │   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── users/\n│   │   └── common/\n│   ├── services/\n│   ├── repositories/\n│   ├── decorators/\n│   ├── pipes/\n│   ├── guards/\n│   └── interceptors/\n├── test/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   ├── integration/\n│   └── e2e/\n├── prisma/\n│   ├── schema.prisma\n│   └── migrations/\n└── docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n### 5. Map Requirements to Structure\n\nCreate explicit mapping from project requirements to specific files/directories:\n\n**Epic/Feature Mapping:**\n\"Epic: User Management\n\n- Components: src/components/features/users/\n- Services: src/services/users/\n- API Routes: src/app/api/users/\n- Database: prisma/migrations/_*users*_\n- Tests: tests/features/users/\"\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n\"Authentication System\n\n- Components: src/components/auth/\n- Services: src/services/auth/\n- Middleware: src/middleware/auth.ts\n- Guards: src/guards/auth.guard.ts\n- Tests: tests/auth/\"\n\n### 6. Generate Structure Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\n\n{{complete_project_tree_with_all_files_and_directories}}\n\n```\n\n### Architectural Boundaries\n\n**API Boundaries:**\n{{api_boundary_definitions_and_endpoints}}\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n{{component_communication_patterns_and_boundaries}}\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n{{service_integration_patterns_and_boundaries}}\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n{{data_access_patterns_and_boundaries}}\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**Feature/Epic Mapping:**\n{{mapping_of_epics_or_features_to_specific_directories}}\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n{{mapping_of_shared_functionality_to_locations}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n{{how_components_within_the_project_communicate}}\n\n**External Integrations:**\n{{third_party_service_integration_points}}\n\n**Data Flow:**\n{{how_data_flows_through_the_architecture}}\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n{{where_and_how_config_files_are_organized}}\n\n**Source Organization:**\n{{how_source_code_is_structured_and_organized}}\n\n**Test Organization:**\n{{how_tests_are_structured_and_organized}}\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n{{how_static_and_dynamic_assets_are_organized}}\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n{{how_the_project_is organized_for_development}}\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n{{how_the_build_process_uses_the_project_structure}}\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n{{how_the_project_structure_supports_deployment}}\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated project structure content and present choices:\n\n\"I've created a complete project structure based on all our architectural decisions.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore innovative project organization approaches\n[P] Party Mode - Review structure from different development perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save this structure and move to architecture validation\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with current project structure\n- Process enhanced organizational insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project structure? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with project structure context\n- Process collaborative insights about organization trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project structure? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n- Load `./step-07-validation.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete project tree defined with all files and directories\n✅ All architectural boundaries clearly documented\n✅ Requirements/epics mapped to specific locations\n✅ Integration points and communication patterns defined\n✅ Project structure aligned with chosen technology stack\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Creating generic placeholder structure instead of specific, complete tree\n❌ Not mapping requirements to specific files and directories\n❌ Missing important integration boundaries\n❌ Not considering the chosen technology stack in structure design\n❌ Not defining how components communicate across boundaries\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-07-validation.md` to validate architectural coherence and completeness.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Coherence Validation\n\nCheck that all architectural decisions work together:\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\n\n- Do all technology choices work together without conflicts?\n- Are all versions compatible with each other?\n- Do patterns align with technology choices?\n- Are there any contradictory decisions?\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\n\n- Do implementation patterns support the architectural decisions?\n- Are naming conventions consistent across all areas?\n- Do structure patterns align with technology stack?\n- Are communication patterns coherent?\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\n\n- Does the project structure support all architectural decisions?\n- Are boundaries properly defined and respected?\n- Does the structure enable the chosen patterns?\n- Are integration points properly structured?\n\n### 2. Requirements Coverage Validation\n\nVerify all project requirements are architecturally supported:\n\n**From Epics (if available):**\n\n- Does every epic have architectural support?\n- Are all user stories implementable with these decisions?\n- Are cross-epic dependencies handled architecturally?\n- Are there any gaps in epic coverage?\n\n**From FR Categories (if no epics):**\n\n- Does every functional requirement have architectural support?\n- Are all FR categories fully covered by architectural decisions?\n- Are cross-cutting FRs properly addressed?\n- Are there any missing architectural capabilities?\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n\n- Are performance requirements addressed architecturally?\n- Are security requirements fully covered?\n- Are scalability considerations properly handled?\n- Are compliance requirements architecturally supported?\n\n### 3. Implementation Readiness Validation\n\nAssess if AI agents can implement consistently:\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\n\n- Are all critical decisions documented with versions?\n- Are implementation patterns comprehensive enough?\n- Are consistency rules clear and enforceable?\n- Are examples provided for all major patterns?\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\n\n- Is the project structure complete and specific?\n- Are all files and directories defined?\n- Are integration points clearly specified?\n- Are component boundaries well-defined?\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\n\n- Are all potential conflict points addressed?\n- Are naming conventions comprehensive?\n- Are communication patterns fully specified?\n- Are process patterns (error handling, etc.) complete?\n\n### 4. Gap Analysis\n\nIdentify and document any missing elements:\n\n**Critical Gaps:**\n\n- Missing architectural decisions that block implementation\n- Incomplete patterns that could cause conflicts\n- Missing structural elements needed for development\n- Undefined integration points\n\n**Important Gaps:**\n\n- Areas that need more detailed specification\n- Patterns that could be more comprehensive\n- Documentation that would help implementation\n- Examples that would clarify complex decisions\n\n**Nice-to-Have Gaps:**\n\n- Additional patterns that would be helpful\n- Supplementary documentation\n- Tooling recommendations\n- Development workflow optimizations\n\n### 5. Address Validation Issues\n\nFor any issues found, facilitate resolution:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\"I found some issues that need to be addressed before implementation:\n\n{{critical_issue_description}}\n\nThese could cause implementation problems. How would you like to resolve this?\"\n\n**Important Issues:**\n\"I noticed a few areas that could be improved:\n\n{{important_issue_description}}\n\nThese aren't blocking, but addressing them would make implementation smoother.

Check for Existing Project Context\n\nFirst, check if project context already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{output_folder}/project-context.md`\n- If exists: Read complete file to understand existing rules\n- Present to user: \"Found existing project context with {number_of_sections} sections. Would you like to update this or create a new one?\"\n\n### 2. Discover Project Technology Stack\n\nLoad and analyze project files to identify technologies:\n\n**Architecture Document:**\n\n- Look for `{output_folder}/architecture.md`\n- Extract technology choices with specific versions\n- Note architectural decisions that affect implementation\n\n**Package Files:**\n\n- Check for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.\n- Extract exact versions of all dependencies\n- Note development vs production dependencies\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n\n- Look for TypeScript config (`tsconfig.json`)\n- Build tool configs (webpack, vite, next.config.js, etc.)\n- Linting and formatting configs (.eslintrc, .prettierrc, etc.)\n- Testing configurations (jest.config.js, vitest.config.ts, etc.)\n\n### 3. Identify Existing Code Patterns\n\nSearch through existing codebase for patterns:\n\n**Naming Conventions:**\n\n- File naming patterns (PascalCase, kebab-case, etc.)\n- Component/function naming conventions\n- Variable naming patterns\n- Test file naming patterns\n\n**Code Organization:**\n\n- How components are structured\n- Where utilities and helpers are placed\n- How services are organized\n- Test organization patterns\n\n**Documentation Patterns:**\n\n- Comment styles and conventions\n- Documentation requirements\n- README and API doc patterns\n\n### 4. Extract Critical Implementation Rules\n\nLook for rules that AI agents might miss:\n\n**Language-Specific Rules:**\n\n- TypeScript strict mode requirements\n- Import/export conventions\n- Async/await vs Promise usage patterns\n- Error handling patterns specific to the language\n\n**Framework-Specific Rules:**\n\n- React hooks usage patterns\n- API route conventions\n- Middleware usage patterns\n- State management patterns\n\n**Testing Rules:**\n\n- Test structure requirements\n- Mock usage conventions\n- Integration vs unit test boundaries\n- Coverage requirements\n\n**Development Workflow Rules:**\n\n- Branch naming conventions\n- Commit message patterns\n- PR review requirements\n- Deployment procedures\n\n### 5. Initialize Project Context Document\n\nBased on discovery, create or update the context document:\n\n#### A. Fresh Document Setup (if no existing context)\n\nCopy template from `{installed_path}/project-context-template.md` to `{output_folder}/project-context.md`\nInitialize frontmatter with:\n\n```yaml\n---\nproject_name: '{{project_name}}'\nuser_name: '{{user_name}}'\ndate: '{{date}}'\nsections_completed: ['technology_stack']\nexisting_patterns_found: { { number_of_patterns_discovered } }\n---\n```\n\n#### B. Existing Document Update\n\nLoad existing context and prepare for updates\nSet frontmatter `sections_completed` to track what will be updated\n\n### 6. Present Discovery Summary\n\nReport findings to user:\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've analyzed your project for {{project_name}} to discover the context that AI agents need.\n\n**Technology Stack Discovered:**\n{{list_of_technologies_with_versions}}\n\n**Existing Patterns Found:**\n\n- {{number_of_patterns}} implementation patterns\n- {{number_of_conventions}} coding conventions\n- {{number_of_rules}} critical rules\n\n**Key Areas for Context Rules:**\n\n- {{area_1}} (e.g., TypeScript configuration)\n- {{area_2}} (e.g., Testing patterns)\n- {{area_3}} (e.g., Code organization)\n\n{if_existing_context}\n**Existing Context:** Found {{sections}} sections already defined. We can update or add to these.\n{/if_existing_context}\n\nReady to create/update your project context.

Technology Stack & Versions\n\nDocument the exact technology stack from discovery:\n\n**Core Technologies:**\nBased on user skill level, present findings:\n\n**Expert Mode:**\n\"Technology stack from your architecture and package files:\n{{exact_technologies_with_versions}}\n\nAny critical version constraints I should document for agents?\"\n\n**Intermediate Mode:**\n\"I found your technology stack:\n\n**Core Technologies:**\n{{main_technologies_with_versions}}\n\n**Key Dependencies:**\n{{important_dependencies_with_versions}}\n\nAre there any version constraints or compatibility notes agents should know about?\"\n\n**Beginner Mode:**\n\"Here are the technologies you're using:\n\n**Main Technologies:**\n{{friendly_description_of_tech_stack}}\n\n**Important Notes:**\n{{key_things_agents_need_to_know_about_versions}}\n\nShould I document any special version rules or compatibility requirements?\"\n\n### 2. Language-Specific Rules\n\nFocus on unobvious language patterns agents might miss:\n\n**TypeScript/JavaScript Rules:**\n\"Based on your codebase, I notice some specific patterns:\n\n**Configuration Requirements:**\n{{typescript_config_rules}}\n\n**Import/Export Patterns:**\n{{import_export_conventions}}\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n{{error_handling_requirements}}\n\nAre these patterns correct? Any other language-specific rules agents should follow?\"\n\n**Python/Ruby/Other Language Rules:**\nAdapt to the actual language in use with similar focused questions.\n\n### 3. Framework-Specific Rules\n\nDocument framework-specific patterns:\n\n**React Rules (if applicable):**\n\"For React development, I see these patterns:\n\n**Hooks Usage:**\n{{hooks_usage_patterns}}\n\n**Component Structure:**\n{{component_organization_rules}}\n\n**State Management:**\n{{state_management_patterns}}\n\n**Performance Rules:**\n{{performance_optimization_requirements}}\n\nShould I add any other React-specific rules?\"\n\n**Other Framework Rules:**\nAdapt for Vue, Angular, Next.js, Express, etc.\n\n### 4. Testing Rules\n\nFocus on testing patterns that ensure consistency:\n\n**Test Structure Rules:**\n\"Your testing setup shows these patterns:\n\n**Test Organization:**\n{{test_file_organization}}\n\n**Mock Usage:**\n{{mock_patterns_and_conventions}}\n\n**Test Coverage Requirements:**\n{{coverage_expectations}}\n\n**Integration vs Unit Test Rules:**\n{{test_boundary_patterns}}\n\nAre there testing rules agents should always follow?\"\n\n### 5.

Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\nIdentify rules that prevent common mistakes:\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n\"Based on your codebase, here are critical things agents must NOT do:\n\n{{critical_anti_patterns_with_examples}}\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n{{specific_edge_cases_agents_should_handle}}\n\n**Security Rules:**\n{{security_considerations_agents_must_follow}}\n\n**Performance Gotchas:**\n{{performance_patterns_to_avoid}}\n\nAre there other 'gotchas' agents should know about?\"\n\n### 8. Generate Context Content\n\nFor each category, prepare lean content for the project context file:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n{{concise_technology_list_with_exact_versions}}\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_critical_language_rules}}\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_framework_patterns}}\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_testing_requirements}}\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_style_and_quality_rules}}\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_workflow_patterns}}\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_anti_patterns_and_edge_cases}}\n```\n\n### 9. Present Content and Menu\n\nAfter each category, show the generated rules and present choices:\n\n\"I've drafted the {{category_name}} rules for your project context.\n\n**Here's what I'll add:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content for this category]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore nuanced rules for this category\n[P] Party Mode - Review from different implementation perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save these rules and move to next category\"\n\n### 10. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute advanced-elicitation.xml with current category rules\n- Process enhanced rules that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these enhanced rules for {{category}}? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute party-mode workflow with category rules context\n- Process collaborative insights on implementation patterns\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to {{category}} rules? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Save the current category content to project context file\n- Update frontmatter: `sections_completed: [...]`\n- Proceed to next category or step-03 if complete\n\n## APPEND TO PROJECT CONTEXT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C' for a category, append the content directly to `{output_folder}/project-context.md` using the structure from step 8.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All critical technology versions accurately documented\n✅ Language-specific rules cover unobvious patterns\n✅ Framework rules capture project-specific conventions\n✅ Testing rules ensure consistent test quality\n✅ Code quality rules maintain project standards\n✅ Workflow rules prevent implementation conflicts\n✅ Content is lean and optimized for LLM context\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly for each category\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Including obvious rules that agents already know\n❌ Making content too verbose for LLM context efficiency\n❌ Missing critical anti-patterns or edge cases\n❌ Not getting user validation for each rule category\n❌ Not documenting exact versions and configurations\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter completing all rule categories and user selects 'C' for the final category, load `./step-03-complete.md` to finalize the project context file.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-03 until all categories are complete and user explicitly selects 'C' for each!\n"}}
