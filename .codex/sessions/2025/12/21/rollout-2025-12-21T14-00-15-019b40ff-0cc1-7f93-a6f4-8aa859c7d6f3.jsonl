This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, while the user brings domain expertise and product vision. Work together as equals. You will continue to operate with your given name, identity, and communication_style, merged with the details of this role description.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self contained instruction file that is a part of an overall workflow that must be followed exactly\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {main_config} and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`\n- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n- `date` as system-generated current datetime\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `steps/step-01-init.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Check for Existing Workflow State\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n**Workflow State Detection:**\n\n- Look for file at `{outputFile}`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n**Continuation Protocol:**\n\n- **STOP immediately** and load `{continueStepFile}`\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle all continuation logic\n- This is an auto-proceed situation - no user choice needed\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Track document counts as you discover files.**\n\nInitialize counters:\n\n```\nbriefCount = 0\nresearchCount = 0\nbrainstormingCount = 0\nprojectDocsCount = 0\n```\n\n**Product Brief (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/*brief*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*brief*.md`\n3. If no main files: Check for sharded brief folder: `{output_folder}/*brief*/**/*.md`\n4. If sharded folder exists: Load EVERY file in that folder completely\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n6. **Update briefCount with number of files found**\n\n**Research Documents (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/research/*research*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*research*.md`\n3. If no main files: Check for sharded research folder: `{output_folder}/*research*/**/*.md`\n4. Load useful research files completely\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n6. **Update researchCount with number of files found**\n\n**Brainstorming Documents (Priority: Analysis → Main):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming/*brainstorming*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*brainstorming*.md`\n3. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n4. **Update brainstormingCount with number of files found**\n\n**Project Documentation (Existing Projects - Brownfield):**\n\n1. Look for index file: `{output_folder}/index.md`\n2. CRITICAL: Load index.md to understand what project files are available\n3. Read available files from index to understand existing project context\n4. This provides essential context for extending existing project with new PRD\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n6. **Update projectDocsCount with number of files found (including index.md)**\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely (no offset/limit)\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture\n- For existing projects, use index.md as guide to what's relevant\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Copy the template from `{prdTemplate}` to `{outputFile}`\n- Initialize frontmatter with proper structure including document counts:\n\n```yaml\n---\nstepsCompleted: []\ninputDocuments: []\ndocumentCounts:\n  briefs: { { briefCount } }\n  research: { { researchCount } }\n  brainstorming: { { brainstormingCount } }\n  projectDocs: { { projectDocsCount } }\nworkflowType: 'prd'\nlastStep: 0\nproject_name: '{{project_name}}'\nuser_name: '{{user_name}}'\ndate: '{{date}}'\n---\n```\n\n#### C. Present Initialization Results\n\n**Setup Report to User:**\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your PRD workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{outputFile}` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\n\n- Product briefs: {{briefCount}} files {if briefCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Research: {{researchCount}} files {if researchCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Brainstorming: {{brainstormingCount}} files {if brainstormingCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Project docs: {{projectDocsCount}} files {if projectDocsCount > 0}✓ loaded (brownfield project){else}(none found - greenfield project){/if}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\n{if projectDocsCount > 0}\n📋 **Note:** This is a **brownfield project**. Your existing project documentation has been loaded. In the next step, I'll ask specifically about what new features or changes you want to add to your existing system.\n{/if}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\"\n\n### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay menu after setup report:\n\n\"[C] Continue - Save this and move to Project Discovery (Step 2 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Update frontmatter with `stepsCompleted: [1]`, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF user provides additional files: Load them, update inputDocuments and documentCounts, redisplay report\n- IF user asks questions: Answer and redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [frontmatter properly updated with stepsCompleted: [1] and documentCounts], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin project discovery.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Existing workflow detected and properly handed off to step-01b\n- Fresh workflow initialized with template and proper frontmatter\n- Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n- All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n- **Document counts stored in frontmatter `documentCounts`**\n- User clearly informed of brownfield vs greenfield status\n- Menu presented and user input handled correctly\n- Frontmatter updated with `stepsCompleted: [1]` before proceeding\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n- Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n- **Not storing document counts in frontmatter**\n- Creating document without proper template structure\n- Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n- Not reporting discovered documents to user clearly\n- Proceeding without user selecting 'C' (Continue)\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

One creator sets up a trip, captures entries with text and media, and can invite friends either to view or contribute. Unlike generic photo dumps, TravelBlogs keeps everything structured by trip, map, and timeline, with lightweight collaboration.\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n- Travelers want a web app (not just phone-only) to organize trip reports for later recall and sharing.\n- Current options feel costly, phone-only, or like generic photo albums that lose the trip narrative.\n- Collaboration is clunky: one person leads but needs to selectively invite friends to view or co-contribute.\n\n### Problem Impact\n- Trips get buried in unsorted photo streams and scattered notes; hard to remember where/when moments happened.\n- Sharing becomes overwhelming: either oversharing on social or sending messy links with no storyline.\n- Couples/solo travelers with friends miss easy “show the trip” moments without exposing everything.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n- Photo apps are album-first and don’t provide trip structure or map+timeline context.\n- Many tools are mobile-only or premium; collaboration is limited or coarse (no clear roles).\n- There’s little narrative scaffolding: no easy way to combine text, media, and location into a cohesive story.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n- Trip-first workspace with map+timeline: entries blend text and media, anchored to time/location.\n- Roles: creator owns the trip; can invite friends to view or to contribute entries.\n- Web-first with mobile capture parity: easy on laptop for organization, simple on phone for capture.\n- Sharing controls: private by default; selective sharing per trip; clean “show the trip” view.\n\n### Key Differentiators\n- Trip-first structure (map + timeline) instead of generic albums.\n- Clear collaboration roles (owner vs viewer vs contributor) for small groups.\n- Web-first organization plus mobile capture; avoids phone-only lock-in and high cost.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n- Solo travelers and couples who want to organize trip memories on the web, not just phone apps.\n- One creator manages the trip; may invite a companion to co-contribute entries/media.\n- Goals: clean map+timeline to recall where/when, narrative-friendly sharing, and optional collaboration with a travel companion.\n- Pain with current tools: costly or mobile-only services, generic photo dumps, messy collab; hard to keep a cohesive trip story.\n\n### Secondary Users\n- View-only friends/family not on the trip who check daily for new entries to follow along.\n- Contributors: trusted companions on the trip who can add entries/media when invited.\n- Value: feel part of the journey virtually; easy, private access without social oversharing.\n\n### User Journey (high level)\n- Discover: learns about TravelBlogs as a trip-first map+timeline journaling tool for private sharing.\n- Onboard: creator sets up a trip, invites a companion (optional), configures who can view vs contribute.\n- Capture/Organize: creator (and invited contributor) add entries with text/media, mapped to time/location; organize later on web.\n- Share/Aha: viewers get daily updates; creator sees a cohesive, shareable map+timeline story instead of scattered photos.\n- Long-term: trip remains a structured, recallable journal; reusable template for future trips.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### User Success\n- Creator daily capture during active trips: creators add ≥1 entry per active trip day.\n- Viewer engagement on active trips: invited viewers check the trip daily when a trip is active.\n- Sharing activation: invited viewers open the shared trip link and view entries within 24h of invite.\n- Collaboration: invited contributors add at least one entry/media on trips with co-authors.\n\n### Business Objectives\n- Adoption: increase number of active trips and invited viewers per trip.\n- Engagement: sustain daily creator posting during active trips; sustain daily viewer checks on active trips.\n- Sharing growth: drive successful invite-to-view conversions.\n- Retention: creators return for new trips after inactive gaps (weeks/months) without churn.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators\n- Creator activity: % of active trip days with ≥1 entry; average entries per active trip.\n- Viewer engagement: % of invited viewers who view within 24h; average daily views during active trips.\n- Sharing conversion: invite-to-view open rate; viewer return rate during trip.\n- Collaboration: % of trips with contributors; entries per contributor.\n\n## MVP Scope\n\n### Core Features\n- Trip-first map+timeline workspace.\n- Daily entry capture with text + media + location/time.\n- Roles and sharing: creator owns the trip; invite viewers or contributors; shareable trip view on web.\n- Web-first experience (mobile capture acceptable but no mobile-only lock-in).\n\n### Out of Scope for MVP\n- Offline sync/offline-first.\n- Premium/paywall features.\n- Advanced editing/automation/AI.\n- Heavy mobile-only app work.\n\n### MVP Success Criteria\n- Creators complete active trips with daily entries.\n- Invited viewers open shared trips within 24h and check updates during active trips.\n- Contributors add entries/media on coauthored trips when invited.\n- Map+timeline shows a cohesive trip story (no scattered photo dumps).\n\n### Future Vision\n- Offline-first with background sync.\n- Richer editing and templates.\n- Analytics and AI summarization.\n- Mobile parity and deeper collaboration features.\n"}}

We'll use the focus areas above to steer recommendation choices.\n\n## Technique Selection\n\n**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques  \n**Analysis Context:** TravelBlogs web app with goals across user problems, features/UX, technical approaches, business/value, differentiation, risks, success metrics.\n\n**Recommended Techniques:**\n- **Question Storming (deep):** Surfaces user problems, pain points, and success metrics to ensure we’re solving the right travel-blogger needs.\n- **SCAMPER Method (structured):** Systematically riffs on features/UX (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) for trips, entries, media, and sharing.\n- **Analogical Thinking (creative):** Borrows proven patterns from adjacent domains (journaling apps, photo galleries, social feeds) to differentiate the travel blogging experience.\n\n**AI Rationale:** Start by clarifying the problem space and success signals (Question Storming), then generate structured feature variations (SCAMPER), and finish by importing winning patterns from related products (Analogical Thinking) to create a differentiated experience.\n\n### Question Storming (locked questions)\n- What do users want to see after opening the app?\n- What’s the fastest action they want on first tap (add entry, upload photos, log a location)?\n- When/where do they usually add entries (on the move vs end-of-day), and what blocks them?\n- How easy is it to switch between trips?\n- How easy is it to set up a new trip?\n\n### SCAMPER – Combine (selected)\n- Trip timeline + map: unified \"map + moments\" with pins showing inline entries/media.\n- Media + notes: default to \"attach media to note\" flow.\n- Trip overview + quick actions: overview card with last entry, next stop, and one-tap add entry/photo.\n\n### SCAMPER – Eliminate (selected)\n- Manual save/publish steps (auto-save drafts, gentle reminders).\n- Mode switches (separate photo vs text vs location modes).\n- Connectivity worries (capture-first, sync-later).\n- Heavy formatting choices upfront (default minimal layout).\n\n### Analogical Patterns (selected)\n- Journaling: metadata auto-capture (location/weather/device).\n- Journaling: day templates/prompt starters.\n- Journaling: media-first capture with later editing.\n- Travel planners: timeline + map dual view.\n- Travel planners: auto time/location stamping.\n\n## Idea Organization and Prioritization\n\n**Top priorities selected:**\n- Unified map+timeline \"moments\" view with pins and inline entries/media.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later edit; no mode switching.\n\n**Rationale:** Both reduce capture friction and improve recall/context (map + timeline) while keeping flow simple (media-first, auto-save).\n\n## Action Plan (next steps)\n\n**Prototype targets**\n- Map+timeline “moments” view: pins + inline entries/media, quick-add from map or timeline.\n- Media-first capture: one-tap photo/video/voice, auto-save drafts, later edit; offline-first with background sync.\n\n**Data model sketch**\n- Trip: id, title, dates, cover, itinerary refs.\n- Entry: id, trip_id, text, media refs, created_at, location/time metadata.\n- Media: id, entry_id, type (photo/video/audio), uri, captured_at, location.\n\n**User validation prompts**\n- “On first open, what do you expect to see/do?” (check map vs feed vs quick-add preference)\n- “How would you switch trips?” (test map/timeline comprehension and trip switch ease)\n- “How should photo/video capture work mid-trip?” (validate media-first + later edit)\n\n**Quick wins**\n- Enable auto-save drafts by default; eliminate manual save/publish.\n- Default to minimal formatting; add richer editing later.\n\n**Wireframes to draft**\n- Home/first-open: map+timeline moments, quick-add, trip switcher.\n- Trip overview: last entry, next stop, quick actions, offline indicator.\n- Capture flow: media-first (photo/video/voice), auto-save draft, later edit; attach location/time/weather.\n- Entry detail: inline media, edit later, simple formatting, sharing toggle.\n- Trip switch: lightweight switcher and “new trip” creation.\n\n**API/backend sketch (first pass)**\n- POST /trips (create), GET /trips, PATCH /trips/:id.\n- POST /entries (trip_id, text?, media refs, captured_at, location), GET /entries?trip_id=, PATCH /entries/:id.\n- POST /media (upload, type, captured_at, location), GET /media/:id.\n- Sync: POST /sync/batch (for offline queue), GET /sync/changes?since=ts.\n- Auth: minimal session/token; consider per-device draft cache.\n\n**Technical considerations**\n- Offline-first: local queue, retry/backoff, conflict resolution favoring newest edit with merge on text.\n- Media storage: local cache + cloud object store; upload resumable.\n- Metadata capture: OS location/time/weather service with privacy opt-in.\n\n**Validation next steps**\n- Build a clickable mock of map+timeline and capture flow; test comprehension and speed to first capture.\n- 5–7 user interviews using the prompts above; measure preference for first screen (map vs feed vs quick-add).\n\n## Text Wireframes (lo-fi)\n\n**Home / first-open**\n- Header: Trip switcher (current trip title ↓), offline badge.\n- Body split: left = map with pins; right = timeline list of “moments” (entry card with photo/thumb, snippet, timestamp, location). Tap pin highlights timeline card.\n- Quick-add: primary button “Add entry/photo” (media-first). Secondary: “New trip”.\n- Footer: sync status, storage indicator.\n\n**Trip overview**\n- Hero: cover image, trip name, dates; quick stats (entries, media count).\n- Cards: “Last entry” preview; “Next stop” slot (manual or parsed); “Quick actions” (Add entry, Add photo/video, Add voice note).\n- Badges: offline/unsynced indicator; draft count if any.\n\n**Capture flow (media-first)**\n- Step 1: one-tap capture chooser (Photo, Video, Voice). Capture → auto-save draft.\n- Step 2: minimal fields: text box (optional), tags (optional). Metadata shown (location/time/weather auto-captured, editable toggle).\n- Draft hint: “Saved automatically; you can edit later.” Actions: Save draft (default), Publish (optional), Discard.\n\n**Entry detail**\n- Header: trip name, timestamp, location; draft badge if unsent.\n- Content: media carousel; text block; map snippet (pin of capture location).\n- Actions: Edit, Share toggle, Add media, Delete draft.\n- Status: sync indicator; “Offline, will sync” message when applicable.\n\n**Trip switcher / new trip**\n- Switcher modal: list of trips (name, dates, cover thumb, last updated); search.\n- New trip: fields for title, dates, cover image (optional), notes; create button.\n\n### Interaction notes\n- Map ↔ Timeline sync: hovering/ tapping a pin scrolls timeline to the matching card; selecting a timeline card highlights the pin.\n- Quick-add default: media-first capture launches camera/photo picker; location/time/weather captured silently; draft auto-saved instantly.\n- Offline states: capture always works; show “Offline, will sync” badge; sync banner appears when back online; retry queue visible from footer/sync panel.\n- Trip switching: switcher remembers last trip; new trip creation is lightweight (title + dates minimum); return to Home with that trip selected.\n- Draft handling: all captures default to draft; publish optional; drafts show badge in Entry detail and Home quick counts.\n"}}

Begin Success Definition Conversation\n\n**Check Input Documents for Success Indicators:**\nAnalyze product brief, research, and brainstorming documents for success criteria already mentioned.\n\n**If Input Documents Contain Success Criteria:**\n\"Looking at your product brief and research, I see some initial success criteria already defined:\n\n**From your brief:**\n{{extracted_success_criteria_from_brief}}\n\n**From research:**\n{{extracted_success_criteria_from_research}}\n\n**From brainstorming:**\n{{extracted_success_criteria_from_brainstorming}}\n\nThis gives us a great foundation. Let's refine and expand on these initial thoughts:\n\n**User Success First:**\nBased on what we have, how would you refine these user success indicators:\n\n- {{refined_user_success_from_documents}}\n- Are there other user success metrics we should consider?\n\n**What would make a user say 'this was worth it'** beyond what's already captured?\"\n\n**If No Success Criteria in Input Documents:**\nStart with user-centered success:\n\"Now that we understand what makes {{project_name}} special, let's define what success looks like.\n\n**User Success First:**\n\n- What would make a user say 'this was worth it'?\n- What's the moment where they realize this solved their problem?\n- After using {{project_name}}, what outcome are they walking away with?\n\nLet's start with the user experience of success.\"\n\n### 2. Explore User Success Metrics\n\nListen for specific user outcomes and help make them measurable:\n\n- Guide from vague to specific: NOT \"users are happy\" → \"users complete [key action] within [timeframe]\"\n- Ask about emotional success: \"When do they feel delighted/relieved/empowered?\"\n- Identify success moments: \"What's the 'aha!' moment?\"\n- Define completion scenarios: \"What does 'done' look like for the user?\"\n\n### 3. Define Business Success\n\nTransition to business metrics:\n\"Now let's look at success from the business perspective.\n\n**Business Success:**\n\n- What does success look like at 3 months? 12 months?\n- Are we measuring revenue, user growth, engagement, something else?\n- What metric would make you say 'this is working'?\n\nHelp me understand what success means for your business.\"\n\n### 4. Challenge Vague Metrics\n\nPush for specificity on business metrics:\n\n- \"10,000 users\" → \"What kind of users? Doing what?\"\n- \"99.9% uptime\" → \"What's the real concern - data loss? Failed payments?\"\n- \"Fast\" → \"How fast, and what specifically needs to be fast?\"\n- \"Good adoption\" → \"What percentage adoption by when?\"\n\n### 5. Connect to Product Differentiator\n\nTie success metrics back to what makes the product special:\n\"So success means users experience [differentiator] and achieve [outcome]. Does that capture it?\"\n\nAdapt success criteria to context:\n\n- Consumer: User love, engagement, retention\n- B2B: ROI, efficiency, adoption\n- Developer tools: Developer experience, community\n- Regulated: Compliance, safety, validation\n- GovTech: Government compliance, accessibility, procurement\n\n### 6. Smart Scope Negotiation\n\nGuide scope definition through success lens:\n\"The Scoping Game:\n\n1. What must work for this to be useful? → MVP\n2. What makes it competitive? → Growth\n3. What's the dream version? → Vision\n\nChallenge scope creep conversationally:\n\n- Could that wait until after launch?\n- Is that essential for proving the concept?\n\nFor complex domains, include compliance minimums in MVP.\"\n\n### 7. Generate Success Criteria Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n[Content about user success criteria based on conversation]\n\n### Business Success\n\n[Content about business success metrics based on conversation]\n\n### Technical Success\n\n[Content about technical success requirements based on conversation]\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n[Content about specific measurable outcomes based on conversation]\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n[Content about MVP scope based on conversation]\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n[Content about growth features based on conversation]\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n[Content about future vision based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 8. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated content and present choices:\n\"I've drafted our success criteria and scope definition based on our conversation.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 7]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's dive deeper and refine these success metrics\n[P] Party Mode - Bring in different perspectives on success criteria\n[C] Continue - Save success criteria and move to User Journey Mapping (Step 4 of 11)\"\n\n### 9. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current success criteria content\n- Process the enhanced success metrics that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the success criteria? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current success criteria\n- Process the collaborative improvements to metrics and scope\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the success criteria? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/prd.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`\n- Load `./step-04-journeys.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 7.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ User success criteria clearly identified and made measurable\n✅ Business success metrics defined with specific targets\n✅ Success criteria connected to product differentiator\n✅ Scope properly negotiated (MVP, Growth, Vision)\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Accepting vague success metrics without pushing for specificity\n❌ Not connecting success criteria back to product differentiator\n❌ Missing scope negotiation and leaving it undefined\n❌ Generating content without real user input on what success looks like\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## DOMAIN CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nIf working in regulated domains (healthcare, fintech, govtech):\n\n- Include compliance milestones in success criteria\n- Add regulatory approval timelines to MVP scope\n- Consider audit requirements as technical success metrics\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-journeys.md` to map user journeys.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-04 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\\n\\n### What Makes This Special\\n\\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\\n\\n## Project Classification\\n\\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \\n**Domain:** general  \\n**Complexity:** low  \\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\\n\\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n### User Success\\n\\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\\n\\n### Business Success\\n\\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\\n\\n### Technical Success\\n\\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\\n- No offline mode required.\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\\n\\n## Product Scope\\n\\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\\n\\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\\n\\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\\n\\n### Vision (Future)\\n\\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\\nEOF\\n\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_OYAS53u666sObHR9SrtrLvqv"}}

Leverage Existing Users & Identify Additional Types\n\n**Check Input Documents for Existing Personas:**\nAnalyze product brief, research, and brainstorming documents for user personas already defined.\n\n**If User Personas Exist in Input Documents:**\n\"I found some fantastic user personas in your product brief! Let me introduce them and see if we need to expand our cast of characters.\n\n**From your brief:**\n{{extracted_personas_from_brief_with_details}}\n\nThese are great starting points! Their stories already give us insight into what they need from {{project_name}}.\n\n**Beyond your identified users, who else touches this system?**\nBased on your product type and scope, we might need:\n\n{{suggest_additional_user_types_based_on_project_context}}\n\nWhat additional user types should we consider for this product?\"\n\n**If No Personas in Input Documents:**\nStart with comprehensive user type discovery:\n\"Now that we know what success looks like, let's map out ALL the people who will interact with {{project_name}}.\n\n**Beyond primary users, who else touches this system?**\nConsider:\n\n- End users (the primary focus)\n- Admins - manage users, settings, content\n- Moderators - review flagged content, enforce rules\n- Support staff - help users, investigate issues\n- API consumers - if dev tool or platform\n- Internal ops - analytics, monitoring, billing\n\nWhat user types should we map for this product?\"\n\n### 2. Create Narrative Story-Based Journeys\n\nFor each user type, create compelling narrative journeys that tell their story:\n\n#### Narrative Journey Creation Process:\n\n**If Using Existing Persona from Input Documents:**\n\"Let's tell {{persona_name}}'s story with {{project_name}}.\n\n**Their Story So Far:**\n{{persona_backstory_from_brief}}\n\n**How {{project_name}} Changes Their Life:**\n{{how_product_helps_them}}\n\nLet's craft their journey narrative - where do we meet them in their story, and how does {{project_name}} help them write their next chapter?\"\n\n**If Creating New Persona:**\n\"Let's bring this user type to life with a compelling story.\n\n**Creating Their Character:**\n\n- **Name**: Give them a realistic name and personality\n- **Situation**: What's happening in their life/work that creates the need?\n- **Goal**: What do they desperately want to achieve?\n- **Obstacle**: What's standing in their way right now?\n\n**How {{project_name}} Becomes Their Solution:**\n{{how_product_solves_their_story}}\n\nNow let's map their journey narrative.\"\n\n**Story-Based Journey Mapping:**\n\n\"Let's craft this as a story with our hero (the user) facing challenges and finding solutions through {{project_name}}:\n\n**Story Structure:**\n\n- **Opening Scene**: Where and how do we meet them? What's their current pain?\n- **Rising Action**: What steps do they take? What do they discover?\n- **Climax**: The critical moment where {{project_name}} delivers real value\n- **Resolution**: How does their situation improve? What's their new reality?\n\n**Use This Narrative Format such as this example:**\n\n```markdown\n**Journey 1: Maria Santos - Reclaiming Her Creative Time**\nMaria is a freelance graphic designer who loves creating beautiful logos but spends hours every week managing client projects, sending invoices, and chasing payments. She feels like she's running a small business instead of doing what she loves. Late one night, while searching for invoicing tools, she discovers CreativeFlow and decides to give it a try.\n\nThe next morning, instead of her usual 30-minute project management routine, she spends 5 minutes setting up her first client in CreativeFlow. The system automatically generates a professional invoice and even suggests follow-up emails based on her communication patterns. When a client asks for a project update, Maria can share a beautiful progress link instead of digging through emails.\n\nThe breakthrough comes when she lands a major corporate client who's impressed by her \"organized and professional\" project setup. Six months later, Maria has doubled her client base and spends 80% of her time actually designing - exactly what she always wanted.\n```\n\n### 3. Guide Journey Exploration\n\nFor each journey, facilitate detailed exploration:\n\n- \"What happens at each step specifically?\"\n- \"What could go wrong here? What's the recovery path?\"\n- \"What information do they need to see/hear?\"\n- \"What's their emotional state at each point?\"\n- \"Where does this journey succeed or fail?\"\n\n### 4. Connect Journeys to Requirements\n\nAfter each journey, explicitly state:\n\"This journey reveals requirements for:\n\n- List specific capability areas (e.g., onboarding, meal planning, admin dashboard)\n- Help user see how different journeys create different feature sets\"\n\n### 5. Aim for Comprehensive Coverage\n\nGuide toward complete journey set:\n\n- **Primary user** - happy path (core experience)\n- **Primary user** - edge case (different goal, error recovery)\n- **Secondary user** (admin, moderator, support, etc.)\n- **API consumer** (if applicable)\n\nAsk: \"Another journey? We should cover [suggest uncovered user type]\"\n\n### 6. Generate User Journey Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## User Journeys\n\n[All journey narratives based on conversation]\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n[Summary of capabilities revealed by journeys based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated journey content and present choices:\n\"I've mapped out the user journeys based on our conversation. Each journey reveals different capabilities needed for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's dive deeper into these user journeys\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives to ensure we have all journeys\n[C] Continue - Save this and move to Domain Requirements (Step 5 of 11)\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current journey content\n- Process the enhanced journey insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the user journeys? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current journeys\n- Process the collaborative journey improvements and additions\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the user journeys? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/prd.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/steps/step-05-domain.md` (or determine if step is optional based on domain complexity)\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing personas from product briefs leveraged when available\n✅ All user types identified (not just primary users)\n✅ Rich narrative storytelling for each persona and journey\n✅ Complete story-based journey mapping with emotional arc\n✅ Journey requirements clearly connected to capabilities needed\n✅ Minimum 3-4 compelling narrative journeys covering different user types\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Ignoring existing personas from product briefs\n❌ Only mapping primary user journeys and missing secondary users\n❌ Creating generic journeys without rich persona details and narrative\n❌ Missing emotional storytelling elements that make journeys compelling\n❌ Missing critical decision points and failure scenarios\n❌ Not connecting journeys to required capabilities\n❌ Not having enough journey diversity (admin, support, API, etc.)\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## JOURNEY TYPES TO ENSURE:\n\n**Minimum Coverage:**\n\n1. **Primary User - Success Path**: Core experience journey\n2. **Primary User - Edge Case**: Error recovery, alternative goals\n3. **Admin/Operations User**: Management, configuration, monitoring\n4. **Support/Troubleshooting**: Help, investigation, issue resolution\n5. **API/Integration** (if applicable): Developer/technical user journey\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-domain.md`.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

We have three core user types plus an admin role:\n\n- Admin (initial setup + user management)\n- Creator/Owner\n- Co‑creator\n- Viewer\n\nI’ve mapped the journeys based on that. Here’s what I’ll add:\n\n```markdown\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password, ready to capture a new trip. He creates a trip, becoming its owner, and invites his partner as a co‑creator and a few friends as viewers. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident it will be easy for viewers to consume on a single page. When he wants to show where he is now, he checks the map/timeline view to ensure the location context is clear. By the end of the trip, he has a structured, shareable narrative rather than a chaotic photo dump.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: account login; trip creation; ownership and permissions; inviting users by role; entry creation with media; map/timeline context; shareable viewing.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Co‑Creator) — Collaborating Without Owning**\nLina receives an invite and logs in with her email. She joins the trip as a co‑creator, adds her own entries, and can edit or delete entries within the trip. She can’t create or delete trips, which keeps ownership clear. When she edits an entry, she expects the change to appear instantly for other collaborators and viewers.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: role‑based permissions; co‑creator entry create/edit/delete; fast updates; clear ownership boundaries.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus opens the trip and wants to feel “part of the travel.” He scans a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate multiple pages to understand today’s update. If he returns tomorrow, he can quickly find the newest entry and see where the author is now.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: media‑first viewing; single‑page entry layout; quick navigation to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns roles (viewer or creator). The admin does not own trips by default but ensures access is set up correctly. This makes it easy to onboard a small group without complicated permissions.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; role assignment; credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- Roles: admin, creator/owner, co‑creator, viewer.\n- Trip ownership model and permissions (owner creates/deletes trips; co‑creators manage entries only).\n- Invite flows with role assignment per trip.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n```\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n[A] Advanced Elicitation – refine these journeys  \n[P] Party Mode – bring in other perspectives  \n[C] Continue – save and move to Domain Requirements (Step 5 of 11)"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\\n\\n### What Makes This Special\\n\\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\\n\\n## Project Classification\\n\\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \\n**Domain:** general  \\n**Complexity:** low  \\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\\n\\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n### User Success\\n\\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\\n\\n### Business Success\\n\\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\\n\\n### Technical Success\\n\\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\\n- No offline mode required.\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\\n\\n## Product Scope\\n\\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\\n\\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\\n\\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\\n\\n### Vision (Future)\\n\\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\\n\\n## User Journeys\\n\\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\\n\\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\\n\\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\\n\\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\\n\\n### Journey Requirements Summary\\n\\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\\nEOF\\n\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_nY0Yte00mnFPMK7DrX5WxtHd"}}

Load Domain Configuration Data\n\nLoad domain-specific configuration for complex domains:\n\n- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/domain-complexity.csv` completely\n- Find the row where `domain` matches the detected domain from step-02\n- Extract these columns:\n  - `key_concerns` (semicolon-separated list)\n  - `required_knowledge` (domain expertise needed)\n  - `web_searches` (suggested research queries)\n  - `special_sections` (domain-specific sections to document)\n\n### 2. Present Domain Complexity Context\n\nStart by explaining why this step is needed:\n\"Since {{project_name}} is in the {domain} domain with high complexity, we need to explore domain-specific requirements.\n\n**Key Concerns for {domain}:**\n[List the key_concerns from CSV]\n\nThis step will help us understand regulatory requirements, compliance needs, and industry-specific constraints that will shape our product.\"\n\n### 3. Explore Domain-Specific Requirements\n\nFor each concern in `key_concerns` from the CSV:\n\n#### Domain Concern Exploration:\n\n- Ask the user about their approach to this concern\n- Discuss implications for the product design and requirements\n- Document specific requirements, constraints, and compliance needs\n\n**Example for Healthcare Domain:**\nIf key_concerns = \"FDA approval;Clinical validation;HIPAA compliance;Patient safety;Medical device classification;Liability\"\n\nAsk about each:\n\n- \"Will this product require FDA approval? What classification?\"\n- \"How will you validate clinical accuracy and safety?\"\n- \"What HIPAA compliance measures are needed?\"\n- \"What patient safety protocols must be in place?\"\n- \"What liability considerations affect the design?\"\n\n### 4. Synthesize Domain Requirements\n\nBased on the conversation, synthesize domain requirements that will shape everything:\n\n#### Categories to Document:\n\n- **Regulatory requirements** (from key_concerns)\n- **Compliance needs** (from key_concerns)\n- **Industry standards** (from required_knowledge)\n- **Safety/risk factors** (from key_concerns)\n- **Required validations** (from key_concerns)\n- **Special expertise needed** (from required_knowledge)\n\nExplain how these inform:\n\n- What features are mandatory\n- What NFRs are critical\n- How to sequence development\n- What validation is required\n\n### 5. Generate Domain-Specific Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### [Domain Name] Compliance & Regulatory Overview\n\n[Domain context summary based on conversation]\n\n### Key Domain Concerns\n\n[Key concerns addressed based on conversation]\n\n### Compliance Requirements\n\n[Compliance requirements based on conversation]\n\n### Industry Standards & Best Practices\n\n[Industry standards based on conversation]\n\n### Required Expertise & Validation\n\n[Required knowledge and validation based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n[Implementation implications based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6. Handle Special Sections\n\nParse `special_sections` list from the matched CSV row. For each section name, generate corresponding subsections:\n\n**Example mappings from CSV:**\n\n- \"clinical_requirements\" → Add clinical validation requirements\n- \"regulatory_pathway\" → Document approval pathway timeline\n- \"safety_measures\" → Specify safety protocols and monitoring\n- \"compliance_matrix\" → Create compliance tracking matrix\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated domain content and present choices:\n\"I've documented the {domain}-specific requirements that will shape {{project_name}}. These constraints are critical for success in this complex domain.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's dive deeper into these domain requirements\n[P] Party Mode - Bring domain expertise perspectives to validate requirements\n[C] Continue - Save this and move to Innovation Focus (Step 6 of 11)\"\n\n### 8.

Listen for Innovation Indicators\n\nMonitor conversation for both general and project-type-specific innovation signals:\n\n#### General Innovation Language:\n\n- \"Nothing like this exists\"\n- \"We're rethinking how [X] works\"\n- \"Combining [A] with [B] for the first time\"\n- \"Novel approach to [problem]\"\n- \"No one has done [concept] before\"\n\n#### Project-Type-Specific Signals (from CSV):\n\nMatch user descriptions against innovation_signals for their project_type:\n\n- **api_backend**: \"API composition;New protocol\"\n- **mobile_app**: \"Gesture innovation;AR/VR features\"\n- **saas_b2b**: \"Workflow automation;AI agents\"\n- **developer_tool**: \"New paradigm;DSL creation\"\n\n### 3. Initial Innovation Screening\n\nAsk targeted innovation discovery questions:\n\"As we explore {{project_name}}, I'm listening for what makes it innovative.\n\n**Innovation Indicators:**\n\n- Are you challenging any existing assumptions about how things work?\n- Are you combining technologies or approaches in new ways?\n- Is there something about this that hasn't been done before?\n\nWhat aspects of {{project_name}} feel most innovative to you?\"\n\n### 4. Deep Innovation Exploration (If Detected)\n\nIf innovation signals are found, explore deeply:\n\n#### Innovation Discovery Questions:\n\n- \"What makes it unique compared to existing solutions?\"\n- \"What assumption are you challenging?\"\n- \"How do we validate it works?\"\n- \"What's the fallback if it doesn't?\"\n- \"Has anyone tried this before?\"\n\n#### Market Context Research:\n\nIf relevant innovation detected, consider web search for context:\nUse `web_search_triggers` from project-type CSV:\n`[web_search_triggers] {concept} innovations {date}`\n\n### 5. Generate Innovation Content (If Innovation Detected)\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n\n[Innovation patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n\n[Market context and research based on conversation]\n\n### Validation Approach\n\n[Validation methodology based on conversation]\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n[Innovation risks and fallbacks based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6.

Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current innovation content\n- Process the enhanced innovation insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the innovation analysis? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current innovation content\n- Process the collaborative innovation exploration and ideation\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the innovation analysis? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/prd.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/steps/step-07-project-type.md`\n\n## NO INNOVATION DETECTED:\n\nIf no genuine innovation signals are found after exploration:\n\"After exploring {{project_name}}, I don't see clear innovation signals that warrant a dedicated innovation section.

Load Project-Type Configuration Data\n\nLoad project-type specific configuration:\n\n- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/project-types.csv` completely\n- Find the row where `project_type` matches detected type from step-02\n- Extract these columns:\n  - `key_questions` (semicolon-separated list of discovery questions)\n  - `required_sections` (semicolon-separated list of sections to document)\n  - `skip_sections` (semicolon-separated list of sections to skip)\n  - `innovation_signals` (already explored in step-6)\n\n### 2. Conduct Guided Discovery Using Key Questions\n\nParse `key_questions` from CSV and explore each:\n\n#### Question-Based Discovery:\n\nFor each question in `key_questions` from CSV:\n\n- Ask the user naturally in conversational style\n- Listen for their response and ask clarifying follow-ups\n- Connect answers to product value proposition\n\n**Example Flow:**\nIf key_questions = \"Endpoints needed?;Authentication method?;Data formats?;Rate limits?;Versioning?;SDK needed?\"\n\nAsk naturally:\n\n- \"What are the main endpoints your API needs to expose?\"\n- \"How will you handle authentication and authorization?\"\n- \"What data formats will you support for requests and responses?\"\n\n### 3. Document Project-Type Specific Requirements\n\nBased on user answers to key_questions, synthesize comprehensive requirements:\n\n#### Requirement Categories:\n\nCover the areas indicated by `required_sections` from CSV:\n\n- Synthesize what was discovered for each required section\n- Document specific requirements, constraints, and decisions\n- Connect to product differentiator when relevant\n\n#### Skip Irrelevant Sections:\n\nSkip areas indicated by `skip_sections` from CSV to avoid wasting time on irrelevant aspects.\n\n### 4. Generate Dynamic Content Sections\n\nParse `required_sections` list from the matched CSV row. For each section name, generate corresponding content:\n\n#### Common CSV Section Mappings:\n\n- \"endpoint_specs\" or \"endpoint_specification\" → API endpoints documentation\n- \"auth_model\" or \"authentication_model\" → Authentication approach\n- \"platform_reqs\" or \"platform_requirements\" → Platform support needs\n- \"device_permissions\" or \"device_features\" → Device capabilities\n- \"tenant_model\" → Multi-tenancy approach\n- \"rbac_matrix\" or \"permission_matrix\" → Permission structure\n\n#### Template Variable Strategy:\n\n- For sections matching common template variables: generate specific content\n- For sections without template matches: include in main project_type_requirements\n- Hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility\n\n### 5. Generate Project-Type Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## [Project Type] Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\n[Project type summary based on conversation]\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n[Technical architecture requirements based on conversation]\n\n[Dynamic sections based on CSV and conversation]\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n[Implementation specific requirements based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6.

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\\n\\n### What Makes This Special\\n\\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\\n\\n## Project Classification\\n\\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \\n**Domain:** general  \\n**Complexity:** low  \\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\\n\\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n### User Success\\n\\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\\n\\n### Business Success\\n\\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\\n\\n### Technical Success\\n\\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\\n- No offline mode required.\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\\n\\n## Product Scope\\n\\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\\n\\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\\n\\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\\n\\n### Vision (Future)\\n\\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\\n\\n## User Journeys\\n\\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\\n\\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\\n\\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\\n\\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\\n\\n### Journey Requirements Summary\\n\\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\\n\\n## Web App Specific Requirements\\n\\n### Project-Type Overview\\n\\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\\n\\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\\n\\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\\n\\n### Browser Matrix\\n\\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\\n\\n### Responsive Design\\n\\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\\n\\n### Performance Targets\\n\\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n\\n### Accessibility Level\\n\\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\\n\\n### Implementation Considerations\\n\\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\\nEOF\\n\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_bdEg3bqgnTa8l6btuIGZvuit"}}

Here's what we've established:\n\n**Product Vision & Success:**\n{{summary_of_vision_and_success_criteria}}\n\n**User Journeys:** {{number_of_journeys}} mapped with rich narratives\n\n**Domain & Innovation Focus:**\n{{summary_of_domain_requirements_and_innovation}}\n\n**Current Scope Implications:**\nBased on everything we've documented, this looks like it could be:\n\n- [ ] Simple MVP (small team, lean scope)\n- [ ] Medium scope (moderate team, balanced features)\n- [ ] Complex project (large team, comprehensive scope)\n\nDoes this initial assessment feel right, or do you see this differently?\"\n\n### 2. Define MVP Strategy\n\nFacilitate strategic MVP decisions:\n\n\"Let's think strategically about your launch strategy:\n\n**MVP Philosophy Options:**\n\n1. **Problem-Solving MVP**: Solve the core problem with minimal features\n2. **Experience MVP**: Deliver the key user experience with basic functionality\n3. **Platform MVP**: Build the foundation for future expansion\n4. **Revenue MVP**: Generate early revenue with essential features\n\n**Critical Questions:**\n\n- What's the minimum that would make users say 'this is useful'?\n- What would make investors/partners say 'this has potential'?\n- What's the fastest path to validated learning?\n\n**Which MVP approach feels right for {{project_name}}?**\"\n\n### 3. Scoping Decision Framework\n\nUse structured decision-making for scope:\n\n**Must-Have Analysis:**\n\"Let's identify absolute MVP necessities. For each journey and success criterion, ask:\n\n- **Without this, does the product fail?** (Y/N)\n- **Can this be manual initially?** (Y/N)\n- **Is this a deal-breaker for early adopters?** (Y/N)\n\n**Current Document Review:**\nLooking at your user journeys, what are the absolute core experiences that must work?\n\n{{analyze_journeys_for_mvp_essentials}}\"\n\n**Nice-to-Have Analysis:**\n\"Let's also identify what could be added later:\n\n**Post-MVP Enhancements:**\n\n- Features that enhance but aren't essential\n- User types that can be added later\n- Advanced functionality that builds on MVP\n\n**What features could we add in versions 2, 3, etc.?**\"\n\n### 4. Progressive Feature Roadmap\n\nCreate phased development approach:\n\n\"Let's map your features across development phases:\n\n**Phase 1: MVP**\n\n- Core user value delivery\n- Essential user journeys\n- Basic functionality that works reliably\n\n**Phase 2: Growth**\n\n- Additional user types\n- Enhanced features\n- Scale improvements\n\n**Phase 3: Expansion**\n\n- Advanced capabilities\n- Platform features\n- New markets or use cases\n\n**Where does your current vision fit in this development sequence?**\"\n\n### 5. Risk-Based Scoping\n\nIdentify and mitigate scoping risks:\n\n**Technical Risks:**\n\"Looking at your innovation and domain requirements:\n\n- What's the most technically challenging aspect?\n- Could we simplify the initial implementation?\n- What's the riskiest assumption about technology feasibility?\"\n\n**Market Risks:**\n\n- What's the biggest market risk?\n- How does the MVP address this?\n- What learning do we need to de-risk this?\"\n\n**Resource Risks:**\n\n- What if we have fewer resources than planned?\n- What's the absolute minimum team size needed?\n- Can we launch with a smaller feature set?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Scoping Content\n\nPrepare comprehensive scoping section:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** {{chosen_mvp_approach}}\n**Resource Requirements:** {{mvp_team_size_and_skills}}\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n{{essential_journeys_for_mvp}}\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n{{list_of_essential_mvp_features}}\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n{{planned_growth_features}}\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n{{planned_expansion_features}}\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** {{mitigation_approach}}\n**Market Risks:** {{validation_approach}}\n**Resource Risks:** {{contingency_approach}}\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the scoping decisions and present choices:\n\n\"I've analyzed your complete PRD and created a strategic scoping plan for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore alternative scoping strategies\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on MVP and roadmap decisions\n[C] Continue - Save scoping decisions and move to Functional Requirements (Step 9 of 11)\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with current scoping analysis\n- Process enhanced scoping insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the scoping decisions? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with scoping context\n- Process collaborative insights on MVP and roadmap decisions\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the scoping decisions? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/prd.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`\n- Load `./step-09-functional.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete PRD document analyzed for scope implications\n✅ Strategic MVP approach defined and justified\n✅ Clear MVP feature boundaries established\n✅ Phased development roadmap created\n✅ Key risks identified and mitigation strategies defined\n✅ User explicitly agrees to scope decisions\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not analyzing the complete PRD before making scoping decisions\n❌ Making scope decisions without strategic rationale\n❌ Not getting explicit user agreement on MVP boundaries\n❌ Missing critical risk analysis\n❌ Not creating clear phased development approach\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-09-functional.md`.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-09 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\\n\\n### What Makes This Special\\n\\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\\n\\n## Project Classification\\n\\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \\n**Domain:** general  \\n**Complexity:** low  \\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\\n\\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n### User Success\\n\\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\\n\\n### Business Success\\n\\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\\n\\n### Technical Success\\n\\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\\n- No offline mode required.\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\\n\\n## Product Scope\\n\\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\\n\\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\\n\\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\\n\\n### Vision (Future)\\n\\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\\n\\n## User Journeys\\n\\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\\n\\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\\n\\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\\n\\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\\n\\n### Journey Requirements Summary\\n\\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\\n\\n## Web App Specific Requirements\\n\\n### Project-Type Overview\\n\\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\\n\\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\\n\\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\\n\\n### Browser Matrix\\n\\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\\n\\n### Responsive Design\\n\\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\\n\\n### Performance Targets\\n\\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n\\n### Accessibility Level\\n\\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\\n\\n### Implementation Considerations\\n\\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\\n\\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\\n\\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\\n\\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \\n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\\n\\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\\n\\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\\n\\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\\n- Create trips\\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\\n\\n### Post-MVP Features\\n\\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\\n- Role-based access controls\\n- Improved sharing controls\\n\\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\\n- Map features and timeline visualization\\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\\n\\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\\n\\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \\n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \\n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\\nEOF\\n\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_cQpv61sdQgpHq2qV5QhyEzaa"}}

Understand FR Purpose and Usage\n\nStart by explaining the critical role of functional requirements:\n\n**Purpose:**\nFRs define WHAT capabilities the product must have. They are the complete inventory of user-facing and system capabilities that deliver the product vision.\n\n**Critical Properties:**\n✅ Each FR is a testable capability\n✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)\n✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW\n✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices\n✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas\n\n**How They Will Be Used:**\n\n1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability\n2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability\n3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability\n\n### 2. Review Existing Content for Capability Extraction\n\nSystematically review all previous sections to extract capabilities:\n\n**Extract From:**\n\n- Executive Summary → Core product differentiator capabilities\n- Success Criteria → Success-enabling capabilities\n- User Journeys → Journey-revealed capabilities\n- Domain Requirements → Compliance and regulatory capabilities\n- Innovation Patterns → Innovative feature capabilities\n- Project-Type Requirements → Technical capability needs\n\n### 3. Organize Requirements by Capability Area\n\nGroup FRs by logical capability areas (NOT by technology or layer):\n\n**Good Grouping Examples:**\n\n- ✅ \"User Management\" (not \"Authentication System\")\n- ✅ \"Content Discovery\" (not \"Search Algorithm\")\n- ✅ \"Team Collaboration\" (not \"WebSocket Infrastructure\")\n\n**Target 5-8 Capability Areas** for typical projects.\n\n### 4. Generate Comprehensive FR List\n\nCreate complete functional requirements using this format:\n\n**Format:**\n\n- FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]\n- Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)\n- Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects\n\n**Altitude Check:**\nEach FR should answer \"WHAT capability exists?\" NOT \"HOW it's implemented?\"\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- ✅ \"Users can customize appearance settings\"\n- ❌ \"Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage\"\n\n### 5. Self-Validation Process\n\nBefore presenting to user, validate the FR list:\n\n**Completeness Check:**\n\n1. \"Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?\"\n2. \"Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?\"\n3. \"Did I cover the project-type specific needs?\"\n4. \"Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?\"\n5. \"Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?\"\n6. \"Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?\"\n\n**Altitude Check:**\n\n1. \"Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?\"\n2. \"Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?\" (Remove if yes)\n3. \"Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?\" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)\n\n**Quality Check:**\n\n1. \"Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?\"\n2. \"Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?\"\n3. \"Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?\" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)\n\n### 6. Generate Functional Requirements Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### [Capability Area Name]\n\n- FR1: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR2: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR3: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n\n### [Another Capability Area]\n\n- FR4: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR5: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n\n[Continue for all capability areas discovered in conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated functional requirements and present choices:\n\"I've synthesized all our discussions into comprehensive functional requirements. This becomes the capability contract that UX designers, architects, and developers will all work from.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete FR list from step 6]\n\n**This is critical because:**\n\n- Every feature we build must trace back to one of these requirements\n- UX designers will ONLY design interactions for these capabilities\n- Architects will ONLY build systems to support these capabilities\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's ensure we haven't missed any capabilities\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives to validate complete coverage\n[C] Continue - Save this and move to Non-Functional Requirements (Step 10 of 11)\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current FR list\n- Process the enhanced capability coverage that comes back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these additions to the functional requirements? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current FR list\n- Process the collaborative capability validation and additions\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the functional requirements? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/prd.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/steps/step-10-nonfunctional.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All previous discovery content synthesized into FRs\n✅ FRs organized by capability areas (not technology)\n✅ Each FR states WHAT capability exists, not HOW to implement\n✅ Comprehensive coverage with 20-50 FRs typical\n✅ Altitude validation ensures implementation-agnostic requirements\n✅ Completeness check validates coverage of all discussed capabilities\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing capabilities from previous discovery sections\n❌ Organizing FRs by technology instead of capability areas\n❌ Including implementation details or UI specifics in FRs\n❌ Not achieving comprehensive coverage of discussed capabilities\n❌ Using vague terms instead of testable capabilities\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## CAPABILITY CONTRACT REMINDER:\n\nEmphasize to user: \"This FR list is now binding. Any feature not listed here will not exist in the final product unless we explicitly add it. This is why it's critical to ensure completeness now.\"\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/steps/step-10-nonfunctional.md` to define non-functional requirements.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-10 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\\n\\n### What Makes This Special\\n\\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\\n\\n## Project Classification\\n\\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \\n**Domain:** general  \\n**Complexity:** low  \\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\\n\\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n### User Success\\n\\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\\n\\n### Business Success\\n\\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\\n\\n### Technical Success\\n\\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\\n- No offline mode required.\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\\n\\n## Product Scope\\n\\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\\n\\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\\n\\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\\n\\n### Vision (Future)\\n\\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\\n\\n## User Journeys\\n\\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\\n\\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\\n\\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\\n\\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\\n\\n### Journey Requirements Summary\\n\\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\\n\\n## Web App Specific Requirements\\n\\n### Project-Type Overview\\n\\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\\n\\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\\n\\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\\n\\n### Browser Matrix\\n\\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\\n\\n### Responsive Design\\n\\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\\n\\n### Performance Targets\\n\\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n\\n### Accessibility Level\\n\\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\\n\\n### Implementation Considerations\\n\\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\\n\\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\\n\\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\\n\\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \\n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\\n\\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\\n\\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\\n\\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\\n- Create trips\\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\\n\\n### Post-MVP Features\\n\\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\\n- Role-based access controls\\n- Improved sharing controls\\n\\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\\n- Map features and timeline visualization\\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\\n\\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\\n\\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \\n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \\n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\\n\\n## Functional Requirements\\n\\n### Accounts & Roles (Post‑MVP)\\n\\n- FR1: Admin can create user accounts.

Explain NFR Purpose and Scope\n\nStart by clarifying what NFRs are and why we're selective:\n\n**NFR Purpose:**\nNFRs define HOW WELL the system must perform, not WHAT it must do. They specify quality attributes like performance, security, scalability, etc.\n\n**Selective Approach:**\nWe only document NFRs that matter for THIS product. If a category doesn't apply, we skip it entirely. This prevents requirement bloat and focuses on what's actually important.\n\n### 2. Assess Product Context for NFR Relevance\n\nEvaluate which NFR categories matter based on product context:\n\n**Quick Assessment Questions:**\n\n- **Performance**: Is there user-facing impact of speed?\n- **Security**: Are we handling sensitive data or payments?\n- **Scalability**: Do we expect rapid user growth?\n- **Accessibility**: Are we serving broad public audiences?\n- **Integration**: Do we need to connect with other systems?\n- **Reliability**: Would downtime cause significant problems?\n\n### 3. Explore Relevant NFR Categories\n\nFor each relevant category, conduct targeted discovery:\n\n#### Performance NFRs (If relevant):\n\n\"Let's talk about performance requirements for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Performance Questions:**\n\n- What parts of the system need to be fast for users to be successful?\n- Are there specific response time expectations?\n- What happens if performance is slower than expected?\n- Are there concurrent user scenarios we need to support?\"\n\n#### Security NFRs (If relevant):\n\n\"Security is critical for products that handle sensitive information.\n\n**Security Questions:**\n\n- What data needs to be protected?\n- Who should have access to what?\n- What are the security risks we need to mitigate?\n- Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?\"\n\n#### Scalability NFRs (If relevant):\n\n\"Scalability matters if we expect growth or have variable demand.\n\n**Scalability Questions:**\n\n- How many users do we expect initially? Long-term?\n- Are there seasonal or event-based traffic spikes?\n- What happens if we exceed our capacity?\"\n- What growth scenarios should we plan for?\"\n\n#### Accessibility NFRs (If relevant):\n\n\"Accessibility ensures the product works for users with disabilities.\n\n**Accessibility Questions:**\n\n- Are we serving users with visual, hearing, or motor impairments?\n- Are there legal accessibility requirements (WCAG, Section 508)?\n- What accessibility features are most important for our users?\"\n\n#### Integration NFRs (If relevant):\n\n\"Integration requirements matter for products that connect to other systems.\n\n**Integration Questions:**\n\n- What external systems do we need to connect with?\n- Are there APIs or data formats we must support?\n- How reliable do these integrations need to be?\"\n\n### 4. Make NFRs Specific and Measurable\n\nFor each relevant NFR category, ensure criteria are testable:\n\n**From Vague to Specific:**\n\n- NOT: \"The system should be fast\" → \"User actions complete within 2 seconds\"\n- NOT: \"The system should be secure\" → \"All data is encrypted at rest and in transit\"\n- NOT: \"The system should scale\" → \"System supports 10x user growth with <10% performance degradation\"\n\n### 5. Generate NFR Content (Only Relevant Categories)\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure (Dynamic based on relevance):\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections (only include sections that are relevant):\n\n```markdown\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Performance\n\n[Performance requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Security\n\n[Security requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Scalability\n\n[Scalability requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Accessibility\n\n[Accessibility requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Integration\n\n[Integration requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n```\n\n### 6. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated NFR content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the non-functional requirements that specify how well {{project_name}} needs to perform. I've only included categories that actually matter for this product.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete NFR content from step 5]\n\n**Note:** We've skipped categories that don't apply to avoid unnecessary requirements.\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's ensure we haven't missed critical quality attributes\n[P] Party Mode - Bring technical perspectives to validate NFR specifications\n[C] Continue - Save this and move to Complete PRD (Step 11 of 11)\"\n\n### 7. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current NFR content\n- Process the enhanced quality attribute insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the non-functional requirements? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current NFR list\n- Process the collaborative technical validation and additions\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the non-functional requirements? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/prd.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/steps/step-11-complete.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Only relevant NFR categories documented (no requirement bloat)\n✅ Each NFR is specific and measurable\n✅ NFRs connected to actual user needs and business context\n✅ Vague requirements converted to testable criteria\n✅ Domain-specific compliance requirements included if relevant\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Documenting NFR categories that don't apply to the product\n❌ Leaving requirements vague and unmeasurable\n❌ Not connecting NFRs to actual user or business needs\n❌ Missing domain-specific compliance requirements\n❌ Creating overly prescriptive technical requirements\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NFR CATEGORY GUIDANCE:\n\n**Include Performance When:**\n\n- User-facing response times impact success\n- Real-time interactions are critical\n- Performance is a competitive differentiator\n\n**Include Security When:**\n\n- Handling sensitive user data\n- Processing payments or financial information\n- Subject to compliance regulations\n- Protecting intellectual property\n\n**Include Scalability When:**\n\n- Expecting rapid user growth\n- Handling variable traffic patterns\n- Supporting enterprise-scale usage\n- Planning for market expansion\n\n**Include Accessibility When:**\n\n- Serving broad public audiences\n- Subject to accessibility regulations\n- Targeting users with disabilities\n- B2B customers with accessibility requirements\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/steps/step-11-complete.md` to finalize the PRD and complete the workflow.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-11 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\\n\\n### What Makes This Special\\n\\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\\n\\n## Project Classification\\n\\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \\n**Domain:** general  \\n**Complexity:** low  \\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\\n\\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n### User Success\\n\\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\\n\\n### Business Success\\n\\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\\n\\n### Technical Success\\n\\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\\n- No offline mode required.\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\\n\\n## Product Scope\\n\\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\\n\\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\\n\\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\\n\\n### Vision (Future)\\n\\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\\n\\n## User Journeys\\n\\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\\n\\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\\n\\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\\n\\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\\n\\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\\n\\n### Journey Requirements Summary\\n\\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\\n\\n## Web App Specific Requirements\\n\\n### Project-Type Overview\\n\\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\\n\\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\\n\\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\\n\\n### Browser Matrix\\n\\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\\n\\n### Responsive Design\\n\\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\\n\\n### Performance Targets\\n\\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\\n\\n### Accessibility Level\\n\\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\\n\\n### Implementation Considerations\\n\\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\\n\\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\\n\\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\\n\\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \\n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\\n\\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\\n\\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\\n\\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\\n- Create trips\\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\\n\\n### Post-MVP Features\\n\\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\\n- Role-based access controls\\n- Improved sharing controls\\n\\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\\n- Map features and timeline visualization\\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\\n\\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\\n\\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \\n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \\n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\\n\\n## Functional Requirements\\n\\n### Accounts & Roles (Post‑MVP)\\n\\n- FR1: Admin can create user accounts.
