Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to delete a trip,\nso that I can remove trips I no longer want to keep.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I choose delete and confirm the action  \n   **Then** the trip is removed from my trip list  \n   **And** I can no longer access its entries\n2. **Given** I initiate delete and cancel the confirmation  \n   **When** I return to the trip view  \n   **Then** the trip remains unchanged\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add delete-trip API endpoint (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Implement `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` in `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`\n  - [ ] Require creator session and enforce ownership (per-trip ACL)\n  - [ ] Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures\n  - [ ] If related data exists (entries/share links), delete via cascade or transaction-safe cleanup\n- [ ] Add delete flow in trip UI (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Add a destructive \"Delete trip\" button on `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx`\n  - [ ] Show confirmation modal with clear cancel/confirm actions\n  - [ ] On confirm, call delete API and redirect to `/trips`\n  - [ ] On cancel, close modal with no data changes\n- [ ] Update trip list state after deletion (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Ensure the deleted trip is removed from list state (Redux or local fetch revalidation)\n- [ ] Tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] API tests under `tests/api/` for success, unauthorized, not-owner, not-found\n  - [ ] Component test for confirmation modal behavior if component test harness exists\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Trip creation and list views are already implemented in Epic 1.2; deletion must integrate without refactors.\n- Deletion is creator-only; viewers should never see delete controls.\n- Ensure delete is a destructive action with a clear confirmation step (UX rule).\n- Regression guardrail: do not rename or restructure existing trip routes or auth/session utilities.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- **API:** `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` using App Router route handlers.\n- **Auth:** Require creator session; verify ownership using session user id.\n- **Data:** Use Prisma to delete by id + ownerId; if related rows exist, delete in a transaction or rely on `onDelete: Cascade`.\n- **Error format:** `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }` on failures (e.g., `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`).\n- **Dates:** If returned, serialize as ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`) with `:id` params.\n- Responses always wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Naming: `camelCase` vars/JSON, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- Tests live under `tests/` only (no co-located tests).\n- Use `src/utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript (existing).\n- Prisma 7.2.0 with SQLite (existing).\n- Zod 4.2.1 for any request validation (server-side only).\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions for auth checks.\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 if updating list state via store.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API: `src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` (DELETE handler).\n- UI: `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx` plus `src/components/trips/` for any modal wrapper.\n- Store: `src/store/trips/trips-slice.ts` if list state updates are required.\n- Tests: `tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts`, `tests/components/trips/delete-trip-modal.test.tsx` (if applicable).\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for success, unauthorized, forbidden (not owner), not found.\n- If a component test harness exists, validate modal confirm/cancel behavior.\n- Ensure tests assert `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Destructive action styling (clay red) with confirmation modal.\n- Cancel should be safe and primary action should be clearly labeled.\n- Maintain 44x44 touch targets and visible focus states.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- App lives under `travelblogs/` with `src/` directory.\n- Keep `.env` and `.env.example` in app root; do not introduce `.env.local`.\n- No Docker/TLS proxy changes in MVP.\n\n### References\n\n- Story source: `_bmad-output/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.3)\n- Architecture rules: `_bmad-output/architecture.md` (API patterns, structure, stack)\n- UX patterns: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md` (destructive actions, modals, accessibility)\n- Previous story context: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-create-trip.md`\n- Global rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 (Codex CLI)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n- Web research skipped due to restricted network access.\n- Git history unavailable (no commits yet).\n- Previous story intelligence applied from 1.2 (Trip model, API patterns, UI routes).\n\n### File List\n\n- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-3-delete-trip.md`\n\n## Completion Checklist\n\n- [ ] `DELETE /api/trips/[id]` implements auth + ownership checks\n- [ ] Trip delete confirmation modal works with cancel/confirm flows\n- [ ] Deleted trip no longer appears in list and is inaccessible\n- [ ] Tests added for API and UI as applicable\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
