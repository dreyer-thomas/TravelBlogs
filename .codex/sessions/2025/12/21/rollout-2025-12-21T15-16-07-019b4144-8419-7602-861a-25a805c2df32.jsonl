Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery:\n\n**PRD (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/*prd*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*prd*.md`\n3. If no main files: Check for sharded PRD folder: `{output_folder}/*prd*/**/*.md`\n4. If sharded folder exists: Load EVERY file in that folder completely for UX context\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Product Brief (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/*brief*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*brief*.md`\n3. If no main files: Check for sharded brief folder: `{output_folder}/*brief*/**/*.md`\n4. If sharded folder exists: Load EVERY file in that folder completely\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Research Documents (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded → Whole):**\n\n1. Check analysis folder: `{output_folder}/analysis/research/*research*.md`\n2. If no analysis files: Try main folder: `{output_folder}/*research*.md`\n3. If no main files: Check for sharded research folder: `{output_folder}/*research*/**/*.md`\n4. Load useful research files completely\n5. Add discovered files to `inputDocuments` frontmatter\n\n**Other Context (Priority: Analysis → Main → Sharded):**\n\n- Epics: `{output_folder}/analysis/*epic*.md` or `{output_folder}/*epic*.md` or `{output_folder}/*epic*/**/*.md`\n- Brainstorming: `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming/*brainstorming*.md` or `{output_folder}/*brainstorming*.md`\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely (no offset/limit)\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/ux-design-template.md` to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\nInitialize frontmatter with:\n\n```yaml\n---\nstepsCompleted: []\ninputDocuments: []\nworkflowType: 'ux-design'\nlastStep: 0\nproject_name: '{{project_name}}'\nuser_name: '{{user_name}}'\ndate: '{{date}}'\n---\n```\n\n#### C. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your UX design workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Product brief: {number of brief files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Other context: {number of other files loaded or \"None found\"}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\n\n[C] Continue to UX discovery\"\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, load `./step-02-discovery.md` to begin the UX discovery phase.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until user explicitly selects [C] to continue!\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR1: Admin can create user accounts.

One creator sets up a trip, captures entries with text and media, and can invite friends either to view or contribute. Unlike generic photo dumps, TravelBlogs keeps everything structured by trip, map, and timeline, with lightweight collaboration.\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n- Travelers want a web app (not just phone-only) to organize trip reports for later recall and sharing.\n- Current options feel costly, phone-only, or like generic photo albums that lose the trip narrative.\n- Collaboration is clunky: one person leads but needs to selectively invite friends to view or co-contribute.\n\n### Problem Impact\n- Trips get buried in unsorted photo streams and scattered notes; hard to remember where/when moments happened.\n- Sharing becomes overwhelming: either oversharing on social or sending messy links with no storyline.\n- Couples/solo travelers with friends miss easy “show the trip” moments without exposing everything.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n- Photo apps are album-first and don’t provide trip structure or map+timeline context.\n- Many tools are mobile-only or premium; collaboration is limited or coarse (no clear roles).\n- There’s little narrative scaffolding: no easy way to combine text, media, and location into a cohesive story.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n- Trip-first workspace with map+timeline: entries blend text and media, anchored to time/location.\n- Roles: creator owns the trip; can invite friends to view or to contribute entries.\n- Web-first with mobile capture parity: easy on laptop for organization, simple on phone for capture.\n- Sharing controls: private by default; selective sharing per trip; clean “show the trip” view.\n\n### Key Differentiators\n- Trip-first structure (map + timeline) instead of generic albums.\n- Clear collaboration roles (owner vs viewer vs contributor) for small groups.\n- Web-first organization plus mobile capture; avoids phone-only lock-in and high cost.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n- Solo travelers and couples who want to organize trip memories on the web, not just phone apps.\n- One creator manages the trip; may invite a companion to co-contribute entries/media.\n- Goals: clean map+timeline to recall where/when, narrative-friendly sharing, and optional collaboration with a travel companion.\n- Pain with current tools: costly or mobile-only services, generic photo dumps, messy collab; hard to keep a cohesive trip story.\n\n### Secondary Users\n- View-only friends/family not on the trip who check daily for new entries to follow along.\n- Contributors: trusted companions on the trip who can add entries/media when invited.\n- Value: feel part of the journey virtually; easy, private access without social oversharing.\n\n### User Journey (high level)\n- Discover: learns about TravelBlogs as a trip-first map+timeline journaling tool for private sharing.\n- Onboard: creator sets up a trip, invites a companion (optional), configures who can view vs contribute.\n- Capture/Organize: creator (and invited contributor) add entries with text/media, mapped to time/location; organize later on web.\n- Share/Aha: viewers get daily updates; creator sees a cohesive, shareable map+timeline story instead of scattered photos.\n- Long-term: trip remains a structured, recallable journal; reusable template for future trips.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### User Success\n- Creator daily capture during active trips: creators add ≥1 entry per active trip day.\n- Viewer engagement on active trips: invited viewers check the trip daily when a trip is active.\n- Sharing activation: invited viewers open the shared trip link and view entries within 24h of invite.\n- Collaboration: invited contributors add at least one entry/media on trips with co-authors.\n\n### Business Objectives\n- Adoption: increase number of active trips and invited viewers per trip.\n- Engagement: sustain daily creator posting during active trips; sustain daily viewer checks on active trips.\n- Sharing growth: drive successful invite-to-view conversions.\n- Retention: creators return for new trips after inactive gaps (weeks/months) without churn.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators\n- Creator activity: % of active trip days with ≥1 entry; average entries per active trip.\n- Viewer engagement: % of invited viewers who view within 24h; average daily views during active trips.\n- Sharing conversion: invite-to-view open rate; viewer return rate during trip.\n- Collaboration: % of trips with contributors; entries per contributor.\n\n## MVP Scope\n\n### Core Features\n- Trip-first map+timeline workspace.\n- Daily entry capture with text + media + location/time.\n- Roles and sharing: creator owns the trip; invite viewers or contributors; shareable trip view on web.\n- Web-first experience (mobile capture acceptable but no mobile-only lock-in).\n\n### Out of Scope for MVP\n- Offline sync/offline-first.\n- Premium/paywall features.\n- Advanced editing/automation/AI.\n- Heavy mobile-only app work.\n\n### MVP Success Criteria\n- Creators complete active trips with daily entries.\n- Invited viewers open shared trips within 24h and check updates during active trips.\n- Contributors add entries/media on coauthored trips when invited.\n- Map+timeline shows a cohesive trip story (no scattered photo dumps).\n\n### Future Vision\n- Offline-first with background sync.\n- Richer editing and templates.\n- Analytics and AI summarization.\n- Mobile parity and deeper collaboration features.\n"}}

We'll use the focus areas above to steer recommendation choices.\n\n## Technique Selection\n\n**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques  \n**Analysis Context:** TravelBlogs web app with goals across user problems, features/UX, technical approaches, business/value, differentiation, risks, success metrics.\n\n**Recommended Techniques:**\n- **Question Storming (deep):** Surfaces user problems, pain points, and success metrics to ensure we’re solving the right travel-blogger needs.\n- **SCAMPER Method (structured):** Systematically riffs on features/UX (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) for trips, entries, media, and sharing.\n- **Analogical Thinking (creative):** Borrows proven patterns from adjacent domains (journaling apps, photo galleries, social feeds) to differentiate the travel blogging experience.\n\n**AI Rationale:** Start by clarifying the problem space and success signals (Question Storming), then generate structured feature variations (SCAMPER), and finish by importing winning patterns from related products (Analogical Thinking) to create a differentiated experience.\n\n### Question Storming (locked questions)\n- What do users want to see after opening the app?\n- What’s the fastest action they want on first tap (add entry, upload photos, log a location)?\n- When/where do they usually add entries (on the move vs end-of-day), and what blocks them?\n- How easy is it to switch between trips?\n- How easy is it to set up a new trip?\n\n### SCAMPER – Combine (selected)\n- Trip timeline + map: unified \"map + moments\" with pins showing inline entries/media.\n- Media + notes: default to \"attach media to note\" flow.\n- Trip overview + quick actions: overview card with last entry, next stop, and one-tap add entry/photo.\n\n### SCAMPER – Eliminate (selected)\n- Manual save/publish steps (auto-save drafts, gentle reminders).\n- Mode switches (separate photo vs text vs location modes).\n- Connectivity worries (capture-first, sync-later).\n- Heavy formatting choices upfront (default minimal layout).\n\n### Analogical Patterns (selected)\n- Journaling: metadata auto-capture (location/weather/device).\n- Journaling: day templates/prompt starters.\n- Journaling: media-first capture with later editing.\n- Travel planners: timeline + map dual view.\n- Travel planners: auto time/location stamping.\n\n## Idea Organization and Prioritization\n\n**Top priorities selected:**\n- Unified map+timeline \"moments\" view with pins and inline entries/media.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later edit; no mode switching.\n\n**Rationale:** Both reduce capture friction and improve recall/context (map + timeline) while keeping flow simple (media-first, auto-save).\n\n## Action Plan (next steps)\n\n**Prototype targets**\n- Map+timeline “moments” view: pins + inline entries/media, quick-add from map or timeline.\n- Media-first capture: one-tap photo/video/voice, auto-save drafts, later edit; offline-first with background sync.\n\n**Data model sketch**\n- Trip: id, title, dates, cover, itinerary refs.\n- Entry: id, trip_id, text, media refs, created_at, location/time metadata.\n- Media: id, entry_id, type (photo/video/audio), uri, captured_at, location.\n\n**User validation prompts**\n- “On first open, what do you expect to see/do?” (check map vs feed vs quick-add preference)\n- “How would you switch trips?” (test map/timeline comprehension and trip switch ease)\n- “How should photo/video capture work mid-trip?” (validate media-first + later edit)\n\n**Quick wins**\n- Enable auto-save drafts by default; eliminate manual save/publish.\n- Default to minimal formatting; add richer editing later.\n\n**Wireframes to draft**\n- Home/first-open: map+timeline moments, quick-add, trip switcher.\n- Trip overview: last entry, next stop, quick actions, offline indicator.\n- Capture flow: media-first (photo/video/voice), auto-save draft, later edit; attach location/time/weather.\n- Entry detail: inline media, edit later, simple formatting, sharing toggle.\n- Trip switch: lightweight switcher and “new trip” creation.\n\n**API/backend sketch (first pass)**\n- POST /trips (create), GET /trips, PATCH /trips/:id.\n- POST /entries (trip_id, text?, media refs, captured_at, location), GET /entries?trip_id=, PATCH /entries/:id.\n- POST /media (upload, type, captured_at, location), GET /media/:id.\n- Sync: POST /sync/batch (for offline queue), GET /sync/changes?since=ts.\n- Auth: minimal session/token; consider per-device draft cache.\n\n**Technical considerations**\n- Offline-first: local queue, retry/backoff, conflict resolution favoring newest edit with merge on text.\n- Media storage: local cache + cloud object store; upload resumable.\n- Metadata capture: OS location/time/weather service with privacy opt-in.\n\n**Validation next steps**\n- Build a clickable mock of map+timeline and capture flow; test comprehension and speed to first capture.\n- 5–7 user interviews using the prompts above; measure preference for first screen (map vs feed vs quick-add).\n\n## Text Wireframes (lo-fi)\n\n**Home / first-open**\n- Header: Trip switcher (current trip title ↓), offline badge.\n- Body split: left = map with pins; right = timeline list of “moments” (entry card with photo/thumb, snippet, timestamp, location). Tap pin highlights timeline card.\n- Quick-add: primary button “Add entry/photo” (media-first). Secondary: “New trip”.\n- Footer: sync status, storage indicator.\n\n**Trip overview**\n- Hero: cover image, trip name, dates; quick stats (entries, media count).\n- Cards: “Last entry” preview; “Next stop” slot (manual or parsed); “Quick actions” (Add entry, Add photo/video, Add voice note).\n- Badges: offline/unsynced indicator; draft count if any.\n\n**Capture flow (media-first)**\n- Step 1: one-tap capture chooser (Photo, Video, Voice). Capture → auto-save draft.\n- Step 2: minimal fields: text box (optional), tags (optional). Metadata shown (location/time/weather auto-captured, editable toggle).\n- Draft hint: “Saved automatically; you can edit later.” Actions: Save draft (default), Publish (optional), Discard.\n\n**Entry detail**\n- Header: trip name, timestamp, location; draft badge if unsent.\n- Content: media carousel; text block; map snippet (pin of capture location).\n- Actions: Edit, Share toggle, Add media, Delete draft.\n- Status: sync indicator; “Offline, will sync” message when applicable.\n\n**Trip switcher / new trip**\n- Switcher modal: list of trips (name, dates, cover thumb, last updated); search.\n- New trip: fields for title, dates, cover image (optional), notes; create button.\n\n### Interaction notes\n- Map ↔ Timeline sync: hovering/ tapping a pin scrolls timeline to the matching card; selecting a timeline card highlights the pin.\n- Quick-add default: media-first capture launches camera/photo picker; location/time/weather captured silently; draft auto-saved instantly.\n- Offline states: capture always works; show “Offline, will sync” badge; sync banner appears when back online; retry queue visible from footer/sync panel.\n- Trip switching: switcher remembers last trip; new trip creation is lightweight (title + dates minimum); return to Home with that trip selected.\n- Draft handling: all captures default to draft; publish optional; drafts show badge in Entry detail and Home quick counts.\n"}}

Review Loaded Context\n\nStart by analyzing what we know from the loaded documents:\n\"Based on the project documentation we have loaded, let me confirm what I'm understanding about {{project_name}}.\n\n**From the documents:**\n{summary of key insights from loaded PRD, briefs, and other context documents}\n\n**Target Users:**\n{summary of user information from loaded documents}\n\n**Key Features/Goals:**\n{summary of main features and goals from loaded documents}\n\nDoes this match your understanding? Are there any corrections or additions you'd like to make?\"\n\n### 2. Fill Context Gaps (If no documents or gaps exist)\n\nIf no documents were loaded or key information is missing:\n\"Since we don't have complete documentation, let's start with the essentials:\n\n**What are you building?** (Describe your product in 1-2 sentences)\n\n**Who is this for?** (Describe your ideal user or target audience)\n\n**What makes this special or different?** (What's the unique value proposition?)\n\n**What's the main thing users will do with this?** (Core user action or goal)\"\n\n### 3. Explore User Context Deeper\n\nDive into user understanding:\n\"Let me understand your users better to inform the UX design:\n\n**User Context Questions:**\n\n- What problem are users trying to solve?\n- What frustrates them with current solutions?\n- What would make them say 'this is exactly what I needed'?\n- How tech-savvy are your target users?\n- What devices will they use most?\n- When/where will they use this product?\"\n\n### 4. Identify UX Design Challenges\n\nSurface the key UX challenges to address:\n\"From what we've discussed, I'm seeing some key UX design considerations:\n\n**Design Challenges:**\n\n- [Identify 2-3 key UX challenges based on project type and user needs]\n- [Note any platform-specific considerations]\n- [Highlight any complex user flows or interactions]\n\n**Design Opportunities:**\n\n- [Identify 2-3 areas where great UX could create competitive advantage]\n- [Note any opportunities for innovative UX patterns]\n\nDoes this capture the key UX considerations we need to address?\"\n\n### 5. Generate Project Understanding Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Executive Summary\n\n### Project Vision\n\n[Project vision summary based on conversation]\n\n### Target Users\n\n[Target user descriptions based on conversation]\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n[Key UX challenges identified based on conversation]\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n[Design opportunities identified based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated project understanding content and present choices:\n\"I've documented our understanding of {{project_name}} from a UX perspective. This will guide all our design decisions moving forward.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 5]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's dive deeper into project understanding\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on user needs and challenges\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to core experience definition\"\n\n### 7. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current project understanding content\n- Process the enhanced project insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the project understanding? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current project understanding\n- Process the collaborative insights and different perspectives that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project understanding? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]`\n- Load `./step-03-core-experience.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All available context documents reviewed and synthesized\n✅ Project vision clearly articulated\n✅ Target users well understood\n✅ Key UX challenges identified\n✅ Design opportunities surfaced\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not reviewing loaded context documents thoroughly\n❌ Making assumptions about users without asking\n❌ Missing key UX challenges that will impact design\n❌ Not identifying design opportunities\n❌ Generating generic content without real project insight\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-03-core-experience.md` to define the core user experience.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-03 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Define Core User Action\n\nStart by identifying the most important user interaction:\n\"Now let's dig into the heart of the user experience for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Core Experience Questions:**\n\n- What's the ONE thing users will do most frequently?\n- What user action is absolutely critical to get right?\n- What should be completely effortless for users?\n- If we nail one interaction, everything else follows - what is it?\n\nThink about the core loop or primary action that defines your product's value.\"\n\n### 2. Explore Platform Requirements\n\nDetermine where and how users will interact:\n\"Let's define the platform context for {{project_name}}:\n\n**Platform Questions:**\n\n- Web, mobile app, desktop, or multiple platforms?\n- Will this be primarily touch-based or mouse/keyboard?\n- Any specific platform requirements or constraints?\n- Do we need to consider offline functionality?\n- Any device-specific capabilities we should leverage?\"\n\n### 3. Identify Effortless Interactions\n\nSurface what should feel magical or completely seamless:\n\"**Effortless Experience Design:**\n\n- What user actions should feel completely natural and require zero thought?\n- Where do users currently struggle with similar products?\n- What interaction, if made effortless, would create delight?\n- What should happen automatically without user intervention?\n- Where can we eliminate steps that competitors require?\"\n\n### 4. Define Critical Success Moments\n\nIdentify the moments that determine success or failure:\n\"**Critical Success Moments:**\n\n- What's the moment where users realize 'this is better'?\n- When does the user feel successful or accomplished?\n- What interaction, if failed, would ruin the experience?\n- What are the make-or-break user flows?\n- Where does first-time user success happen?\"\n\n### 5. Synthesize Experience Principles\n\nExtract guiding principles from the conversation:\n\"Based on our discussion, I'm hearing these core experience principles for {{project_name}}:\n\n**Experience Principles:**\n\n- [Principle 1 based on core action focus]\n- [Principle 2 based on effortless interactions]\n- [Principle 3 based on platform considerations]\n- [Principle 4 based on critical success moments]\n\nThese principles will guide all our UX decisions. Do these capture what's most important?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Core Experience Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\n[Core experience definition based on conversation]\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\n[Platform requirements and decisions based on conversation]\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n[Effortless interaction areas identified based on conversation]\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n[Critical success moments defined based on conversation]\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n[Guiding principles for UX decisions based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated core experience content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the core user experience for {{project_name}} based on our conversation. This establishes the foundation for all our UX design decisions.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine the core experience definition\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on the user experience\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to emotional response definition\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current core experience content\n- Process the enhanced experience insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the core experience definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current core experience definition\n- Process the collaborative experience improvements that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the core experience definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`\n- Load `./step-04-emotional-response.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Core user action clearly identified and defined\n✅ Platform requirements thoroughly explored\n✅ Effortless interaction areas identified\n✅ Critical success moments mapped out\n✅ Experience principles established as guiding framework\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing the core user action that defines the product\n❌ Not properly considering platform requirements\n❌ Overlooking what should be effortless for users\n❌ Not identifying critical make-or-break interactions\n❌ Experience principles too generic or not actionable\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-emotional-response.md` to define desired emotional responses.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-04 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Explore Core Emotional Goals\n\nStart by understanding the emotional objectives:\n\"Now let's think about how {{project_name}} should make users feel.\n\n**Emotional Response Questions:**\n\n- What should users FEEL when using this product?\n- What emotion would make them tell a friend about this?\n- How should users feel after accomplishing their primary goal?\n- What feeling differentiates this from competitors?\n\nCommon emotional goals: Empowered and in control? Delighted and surprised? Efficient and productive? Creative and inspired? Calm and focused? Connected and engaged?\"\n\n### 2. Identify Emotional Journey Mapping\n\nExplore feelings at different stages:\n\"**Emotional Journey Considerations:**\n\n- How should users feel when they first discover the product?\n- What emotion during the core experience/action?\n- How should they feel after completing their task?\n- What if something goes wrong - what emotional response do we want?\n- How should they feel when returning to use it again?\"\n\n### 3. Define Micro-Emotions\n\nSurface subtle but important emotional states:\n\"**Micro-Emotions to Consider:**\n\n- Confidence vs. Confusion\n- Trust vs. Skepticism\n- Excitement vs. Anxiety\n- Accomplishment vs. Frustration\n- Delight vs. Satisfaction\n- Belonging vs. Isolation\n\nWhich of these emotional states are most critical for your product's success?\"\n\n### 4. Connect Emotions to UX Decisions\n\nLink feelings to design implications:\n\"**Design Implications:**\n\n- If we want users to feel [emotional state], what UX choices support this?\n- What interactions might create negative emotions we want to avoid?\n- Where can we add moments of delight or surprise?\n- How do we build trust and confidence through design?\n\n**Emotion-Design Connections:**\n\n- [Emotion 1] → [UX design approach]\n- [Emotion 2] → [UX design approach]\n- [Emotion 3] → [UX design approach]\"\n\n### 5. Validate Emotional Goals\n\nCheck if emotional goals align with product vision:\n\"Let me make sure I understand the emotional vision for {{project_name}}:\n\n**Primary Emotional Goal:** [Summarize main emotional response]\n**Secondary Feelings:** [List supporting emotional states]\n**Emotions to Avoid:** [List negative emotions to prevent]\n\nDoes this capture the emotional experience you want to create? Any adjustments needed?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Emotional Response Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n[Primary emotional goals based on conversation]\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n[Emotional journey mapping based on conversation]\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n[Micro-emotions identified based on conversation]\n\n### Design Implications\n\n[UX design implications for emotional responses based on conversation]\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n[Guiding principles for emotional design based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated emotional response content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the desired emotional responses for {{project_name}}. These emotional goals will guide our design decisions to create the right user experience.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine the emotional response definition\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on user emotional needs\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to inspiration analysis\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current emotional response content\n- Process the enhanced emotional insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the emotional response definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current emotional response definition\n- Process the collaborative emotional insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the emotional response definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n- Load `./step-05-inspiration.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Primary emotional goals clearly defined\n✅ Emotional journey mapped across user experience\n✅ Micro-emotions identified and addressed\n✅ Design implications connected to emotional responses\n✅ Emotional design principles established\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing core emotional goals or being too generic\n❌ Not considering emotional journey across different stages\n❌ Overlooking micro-emotions that impact user satisfaction\n❌ Not connecting emotional goals to specific UX design choices\n❌ Emotional principles too vague or not actionable\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-inspiration.md` to analyze UX patterns from inspiring products.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify User's Favorite Apps\n\nStart by gathering inspiration sources:\n\"Let's learn from products your users already love and use regularly.\n\n**Inspiration Questions:**\n\n- Name 2-3 apps your target users already love and USE frequently\n- For each one, what do they do well from a UX perspective?\n- What makes the experience compelling or delightful?\n- What keeps users coming back to these apps?\n\nThink about apps in your category or even unrelated products that have great UX.\"\n\n### 2. Analyze UX Patterns and Principles\n\nBreak down what makes these apps successful:\n\"For each inspiring app, let's analyze their UX success:\n\n**For [App Name]:**\n\n- What core problem does it solve elegantly?\n- What makes the onboarding experience effective?\n- How do they handle navigation and information hierarchy?\n- What are their most innovative or delightful interactions?\n- What visual design choices support the user experience?\n- How do they handle errors or edge cases?\"\n\n### 3. Extract Transferable Patterns\n\nIdentify patterns that could apply to your project:\n\"**Transferable UX Patterns:**\nLooking across these inspiring apps, I see patterns we could adapt:\n\n**Navigation Patterns:**\n\n- [Pattern 1] - could work for your [specific use case]\n- [Pattern 2] - might solve your [specific challenge]\n\n**Interaction Patterns:**\n\n- [Pattern 1] - excellent for [your user goal]\n- [Pattern 2] - addresses [your user pain point]\n\n**Visual Patterns:**\n\n- [Pattern 1] - supports your [emotional goal]\n- [Pattern 2] - aligns with your [platform requirements]\n\nWhich of these patterns resonate most for your product?\"\n\n### 4. Identify Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\nSurface what not to do based on analysis:\n\"**UX Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\nFrom analyzing both successes and failures in your space, here are patterns to avoid:\n\n- [Anti-pattern 1] - users find this confusing/frustrating\n- [Anti-pattern 2] - this creates unnecessary friction\n- [Anti-pattern 3] - doesn't align with your [emotional goals]\n\nLearning from others' mistakes is as important as learning from their successes.\"\n\n### 5. Define Design Inspiration Strategy\n\nCreate a clear strategy for using this inspiration:\n\"**Design Inspiration Strategy:**\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n\n- [Specific pattern] - because it supports [your core experience]\n- [Specific pattern] - because it aligns with [user needs]\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n\n- [Specific pattern] - modify for [your unique requirements]\n- [Specific pattern] - simplify for [your user skill level]\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n\n- [Specific anti-pattern] - conflicts with [your goals]\n- [Specific anti-pattern] - doesn't fit [your platform]\n\nThis strategy will guide our design decisions while keeping {{project_name}} unique.\"\n\n### 6. Generate Inspiration Analysis Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n[Analysis of inspiring products based on conversation]\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n[Transferable patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n[Anti-patterns to avoid based on conversation]\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n[Strategy for using inspiration based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated inspiration analysis content and present choices:\n\"I've analyzed inspiring UX patterns and products to inform our design strategy for {{project_name}}. This gives us a solid foundation of proven patterns to build upon.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's deepen our UX pattern analysis\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on inspiration sources\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to design system choice\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current inspiration analysis content\n- Process the enhanced pattern insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the inspiration analysis? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current inspiration analysis\n- Process the collaborative pattern insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the inspiration analysis? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n- Load `./step-06-design-system.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Inspiring products identified and analyzed thoroughly\n✅ UX patterns extracted and categorized effectively\n✅ Transferable patterns identified for current project\n✅ Anti-patterns identified to avoid common mistakes\n✅ Clear design inspiration strategy established\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not getting specific examples of inspiring products\n❌ Surface-level analysis without deep pattern extraction\n❌ Missing opportunities for pattern adaptation\n❌ Not identifying relevant anti-patterns to avoid\n❌ Strategy too generic or not actionable\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-06-design-system.md` to choose the appropriate design system approach.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-06 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Present Design System Options\n\nEducate about design system approaches:\n\"For {{project_name}}, we need to choose a design system foundation. Think of design systems like LEGO blocks for UI - they provide proven components and patterns, ensuring consistency and speeding development.\n\n**Design System Approaches:**\n\n**1. Custom Design System**\n\n- Complete visual uniqueness\n- Full control over every component\n- Higher initial investment\n- Perfect for established brands with unique needs\n\n**2. Established System (Material Design, Ant Design, etc.)**\n\n- Fast development with proven patterns\n- Great defaults and accessibility built-in\n- Less visual differentiation\n- Ideal for startups or internal tools\n\n**3. Themeable System (MUI, Chakra UI, Tailwind UI)**\n\n- Customizable with strong foundation\n- Brand flexibility with proven components\n- Moderate learning curve\n- Good balance of speed and uniqueness\n\nWhich direction feels right for your project?\"\n\n### 2. Analyze Project Requirements\n\nGuide decision based on project context:\n\"**Let's consider your specific needs:**\n\n**Based on our previous conversations:**\n\n- Platform: [platform from step 3]\n- Timeline: [inferred from user conversation]\n- Team Size: [inferred from user conversation]\n- Brand Requirements: [inferred from user conversation]\n- Technical Constraints: [inferred from user conversation]\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n\n- Need for speed vs. need for uniqueness\n- Brand guidelines or existing visual identity\n- Team's design expertise\n- Long-term maintenance considerations\n- Integration requirements with existing systems\"\n\n### 3. Explore Specific Design System Options\n\nDive deeper into relevant options:\n\"**Recommended Options Based on Your Needs:**\n\n**For [Your Platform Type]:**\n\n- [Option 1] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]\n- [Option 2] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]\n- [Option 3] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- Component library size and quality\n- Documentation and community support\n- Customization capabilities\n- Accessibility compliance\n- Performance characteristics\n- Learning curve for your team\"\n\n### 4. Facilitate Decision Process\n\nHelp user make informed choice:\n\"**Decision Framework:**\n\n1. What's most important: Speed, uniqueness, or balance?\n2. How much design expertise does your team have?\n3. Are there existing brand guidelines to follow?\n4. What's your timeline and budget?\n5. Long-term maintenance needs?\n\nLet's evaluate options based on your answers to these questions.\"\n\n### 5. Finalize Design System Choice\n\nConfirm and document the decision:\n\"Based on our analysis, I recommend [Design System Choice] for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- [Reason 1 based on project needs]\n- [Reason 2 based on constraints]\n- [Reason 3 based on team considerations]\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- We'll customize this system to match your brand and needs\n- Define component strategy for custom components needed\n- Establish design tokens and patterns\n\nDoes this design system choice feel right to you?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Design System Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n[Design system choice based on conversation]\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n[Rationale for design system selection based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n[Implementation approach based on chosen system]\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n[Customization strategy based on project needs]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated design system content and present choices:\n\"I've documented our design system choice for {{project_name}}. This foundation will ensure consistency and speed up development.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our design system decision\n[P] Party Mode - Bring technical perspectives on design systems\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to defining experience\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current design system content\n- Process the enhanced design system insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the design system decision? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current design system choice\n- Process the collaborative design system insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the design system decision? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n- Load `./step-07-defining-experience.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Design system options clearly presented and explained\n✅ Decision framework applied to project requirements\n✅ Specific design system chosen with clear rationale\n✅ Implementation approach planned\n✅ Customization strategy defined\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not explaining design system concepts clearly\n❌ Rushing to recommendation without understanding requirements\n❌ Not considering technical constraints or team capabilities\n❌ Choosing design system without clear rationale\n❌ Not planning implementation approach\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-07-defining-experience.md` to define the core user interaction.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify the Defining Experience\n\nFocus on the core interaction:\n\"Every successful product has a defining experience - the core interaction that, if we nail it, everything else follows.\n\n**Think about these famous examples:**\n\n- Tinder: \"Swipe to match with people\"\n- Snapchat: \"Share photos that disappear\"\n- Instagram: \"Share perfect moments with filters\"\n- Spotify: \"Discover and play any song instantly\"\n\n**For {{project_name}}:**\nWhat's the core action that users will describe to their friends?\nWhat's the interaction that makes users feel successful?\nIf we get ONE thing perfectly right, what should it be?\"\n\n### 2. Explore the User's Mental Model\n\nUnderstand how users think about the core task:\n\"**User Mental Model Questions:**\n\n- How do users currently solve this problem?\n- What mental model do they bring to this task?\n- What's their expectation for how this should work?\n- Where are they likely to get confused or frustrated?\n\n**Current Solutions:**\n\n- What do users love/hate about existing approaches?\n- What shortcuts or workarounds do they use?\n- What makes existing solutions feel magical or terrible?\"\n\n### 3. Define Success Criteria for Core Experience\n\nEstablish what makes the core interaction successful:\n\"**Core Experience Success Criteria:**\n\n- What makes users say 'this just works'?\n- When do they feel smart or accomplished?\n- What feedback tells them they're doing it right?\n- How fast should it feel?\n- What should happen automatically?\n\n**Success Indicators:**\n\n- [Success indicator 1]\n- [Success indicator 2]\n- [Success indicator 3]\"\n\n### 4. Identify Novel vs. Established Patterns\n\nDetermine if we need to innovate or can use proven patterns:\n\"**Pattern Analysis:**\nLooking at your core experience, does this:\n\n- Use established UX patterns that users already understand?\n- Require novel interaction design that needs user education?\n- Combine familiar patterns in innovative ways?\n\n**If Novel:**\n\n- What makes this different from existing approaches?\n- How will we teach users this new pattern?\n- What familiar metaphors can we use?\n\n**If Established:**\n\n- Which proven patterns should we adopt?\n- How can we innovate within familiar patterns?\n- What's our unique twist on established interactions?\"\n\n### 5. Define Experience Mechanics\n\nBreak down the core interaction into details:\n\"**Core Experience Mechanics:**\nLet's design the step-by-step flow for [defining experience]:\n\n**1. Initiation:**\n\n- How does the user start this action?\n- What triggers or invites them to begin?\n\n**2. Interaction:**\n\n- What does the user actually do?\n- What controls or inputs do they use?\n- How does the system respond?\n\n**3. Feedback:**\n\n- What tells users they're succeeding?\n- How do they know when it's working?\n- What happens if they make a mistake?\n\n**4. Completion:**\n\n- How do users know they're done?\n- What's the successful outcome?\n- What's next?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Defining Experience Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\n[Defining experience description based on conversation]\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\n[User mental model analysis based on conversation]\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n[Success criteria for core experience based on conversation]\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\n[Novel UX patterns analysis based on conversation]\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n[Detailed mechanics for core experience based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated defining experience content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the core experience for {{project_name}} - the interaction that will make users love this product.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine the core experience definition\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on the defining interaction\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to visual foundation\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current defining experience content\n- Process the enhanced experience insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the defining experience? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current defining experience\n- Process the collaborative experience insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the defining experience? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n- Load `./step-08-visual-foundation.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Defining experience clearly articulated\n✅ User mental model thoroughly analyzed\n✅ Success criteria established for core interaction\n✅ Novel vs. established patterns properly evaluated\n✅ Experience mechanics designed in detail\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not identifying the true core interaction\n❌ Missing user's mental model and expectations\n❌ Not establishing clear success criteria\n❌ Not properly evaluating novel vs. established patterns\n❌ Experience mechanics too vague or incomplete\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-08-visual-foundation.md` to establish visual design foundation.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-08 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra‑fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n```\n\nWhat would you like to do?  \n[A] Advanced Elicitation  \n[P] Party Mode  \n[C] Continue"}}

Core User Experience\n+\n+### 2.1 Defining Experience\n+\n+Open the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n+\n+### 2.2 User Mental Model\n+\n+Users currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n+\n+### 2.3 Success Criteria\n+\n+- Active trip is visible on launch.\n+- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n+- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n+- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n+- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n+\n+### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n+\n+Use familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n+\n+### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n+\n+**1. Initiation:**  \n+User opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n+\n+**2. Interaction:**  \n+Tap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n+\n+**3. Feedback:**  \n+Entry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n+\n+**4. Completion:**  \n+User finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n*** End Patch"}}

Brand Guidelines Assessment\n\nCheck for existing brand requirements:\n\"Do you have existing brand guidelines or a specific color palette I should follow? (y/n)\n\nIf yes, I'll extract and document your brand colors and create semantic color mappings.\nIf no, I'll generate theme options based on your project's personality and emotional goals from our earlier discussion.\"\n\n### 2. Generate Color Theme Options (If no brand guidelines)\n\nCreate visual exploration opportunities:\n\"If no existing brand guidelines, I'll create a color theme visualizer to help you explore options.\n\n🎨 I can generate comprehensive HTML color theme visualizers with multiple theme options, complete UI examples, and the ability to see how colors work in real interface contexts.\n\nThis will help you make an informed decision about the visual direction for {{project_name}}.\"\n\n### 3. Define Typography System\n\nEstablish the typographic foundation:\n\"**Typography Questions:**\n\n- What should the overall tone feel like? (Professional, friendly, modern, classic?)\n- How much text content will users read? (Headings only? Long-form content?)\n- Any accessibility requirements for font sizes or contrast?\n- Any brand fonts we must use?\n\n**Typography Strategy:**\n\n- Choose primary and secondary typefaces\n- Establish type scale (h1, h2, h3, body, etc.)\n- Define line heights and spacing relationships\n- Consider readability and accessibility\"\n\n### 4. Establish Spacing and Layout Foundation\n\nDefine the structural foundation:\n\"**Spacing and Layout Foundation:**\n\n- How should the overall layout feel? (Dense and efficient? Airy and spacious?)\n- What spacing unit should we use? (4px, 8px, 12px base?)\n- How much white space should be between elements?\n- Should we use a grid system? If so, what column structure?\n\n**Layout Principles:**\n\n- [Layout principle 1 based on product type]\n- [Layout principle 2 based on user needs]\n- [Layout principle 3 based on platform requirements]\"\n\n### 5. Create Visual Foundation Strategy\n\nSynthesize all visual decisions:\n\"**Visual Foundation Strategy:**\n\n**Color System:**\n\n- [Color strategy based on brand guidelines or generated themes]\n- Semantic color mapping (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, etc.)\n- Accessibility compliance (contrast ratios)\n\n**Typography System:**\n\n- [Typography strategy based on content needs and tone]\n- Type scale and hierarchy\n- Font pairing rationale\n\n**Spacing & Layout:**\n\n- [Spacing strategy based on content density and platform]\n- Grid system approach\n- Component spacing relationships\n\nThis foundation will ensure consistency across all our design decisions.\"\n\n### 6. Generate Visual Foundation Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\n[Color system strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Typography System\n\n[Typography system strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n[Spacing and layout foundation based on conversation]\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n[Accessibility considerations based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated visual foundation content and present choices:\n\"I've established the visual design foundation for {{project_name}}. This provides the building blocks for consistent, beautiful design.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our visual foundation\n[P] Party Mode - Bring design perspectives on visual choices\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to design directions\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current visual foundation content\n- Process the enhanced visual insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the visual foundation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current visual foundation\n- Process the collaborative visual insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the visual foundation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`\n- Load `./step-09-design-directions.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Brand guidelines assessed and incorporated if available\n✅ Color system established with accessibility consideration\n✅ Typography system defined with appropriate hierarchy\n✅ Spacing and layout foundation created\n✅ Visual foundation strategy documented\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not checking for existing brand guidelines first\n❌ Color palette not aligned with emotional goals\n❌ Typography not suitable for content type or readability needs\n❌ Spacing system not appropriate for content density\n❌ Missing accessibility considerations\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-09-design-directions.md` to generate design direction mockups.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-09 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Present Design Exploration Framework\n\nGuide evaluation criteria:\n\"As you explore the design directions, look for:\n\n✅ **Layout Intuitiveness** - Which information hierarchy matches your priorities?\n✅ **Interaction Style** - Which interaction style fits your core experience?\n✅ **Visual Weight** - Which visual density feels right for your brand?\n✅ **Navigation Approach** - Which navigation pattern matches user expectations?\n✅ **Component Usage** - How well do the components support your user journeys?\n✅ **Brand Alignment** - Which direction best supports your emotional goals?\n\nTake your time exploring - this is a crucial decision that will guide all our design work!\"\n\n### 4. Facilitate Design Direction Selection\n\nHelp user choose or combine elements:\n\"After exploring all the design directions:\n\n**Which approach resonates most with you?**\n\n- Pick a favorite direction as-is\n- Combine elements from multiple directions\n- Request modifications to any direction\n- Use one direction as a base and iterate\n\n**Tell me:**\n\n- Which layout feels most intuitive for your users?\n- Which visual weight matches your brand personality?\n- Which interaction style supports your core experience?\n- Are there elements from different directions you'd like to combine?\"\n\n### 5. Document Design Direction Decision\n\nCapture the chosen approach:\n\"Based on your exploration, I'm understanding your design direction preference:\n\n**Chosen Direction:** [Direction number or combination]\n**Key Elements:** [Specific elements you liked]\n**Modifications Needed:** [Any changes requested]\n**Rationale:** [Why this direction works for your product]\n\nThis will become our design foundation moving forward. Are we ready to lock this in, or do you want to explore variations?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Design Direction Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n[Summary of design directions explored based on conversation]\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n[Chosen design direction based on conversation]\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n[Rationale for design direction choice based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n[Implementation approach based on chosen direction]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated design direction content and present choices:\n\"I've documented our design direction decision for {{project_name}}. This visual approach will guide all our detailed design work.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our design direction\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on visual choices\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to user journey flows\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current design direction content\n- Process the enhanced design insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the design direction? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current design direction\n- Process the collaborative design insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the design direction? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n- Load `./step-10-user-journeys.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Multiple design direction variations generated\n✅ HTML showcase created with interactive elements\n✅ Design evaluation criteria clearly established\n✅ User able to explore and compare directions effectively\n✅ Design direction decision made with clear rationale\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not creating enough variation in design directions\n❌ Design directions not aligned with established foundation\n❌ Missing interactive elements in HTML showcase\n❌ Not providing clear evaluation criteria\n❌ Rushing decision without thorough exploration\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-10-user-journeys.md` to design user journey flows.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-10 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Load PRD User Journeys as Foundation\n\nStart with user journeys already defined in the PRD:\n\"Great! Since we have the PRD available, let's build on the user journeys already documented there.\n\n**Existing User Journeys from PRD:**\nI've already loaded these user journeys from your PRD:\n[Journey narratives from PRD input documents]\n\nThese journeys tell us **who** users are and **why** they take certain actions. Now we need to design **how** those journeys work in detail.\n\n**Critical Journeys to Design Flows For:**\nLooking at the PRD journeys, I need to design detailed interaction flows for:\n\n- [Critical journey 1 identified from PRD narratives]\n- [Critical journey 2 identified from PRD narratives]\n- [Critical journey 3 identified from PRD narratives]\n\nThe PRD gave us the stories - now we design the mechanics!\"\n\n### 2. Design Each Journey Flow\n\nFor each critical journey, design detailed flow:\n\n**For [Journey Name]:**\n\"Let's design the flow for users accomplishing [journey goal].\n\n**Flow Design Questions:**\n\n- How do users start this journey? (entry point)\n- What information do they need at each step?\n- What decisions do they need to make?\n- How do they know they're progressing successfully?\n- What does success look like for this journey?\n- Where might they get confused or stuck?\n- How do they recover from errors?\"\n\n### 3. Create Flow Diagrams\n\nVisualize each journey with Mermaid diagrams:\n\"I'll create detailed flow diagrams for each journey showing:\n\n**[Journey Name] Flow:**\n\n- Entry points and triggers\n- Decision points and branches\n- Success and failure paths\n- Error recovery mechanisms\n- Progressive disclosure of information\n\nEach diagram will map the complete user experience from start to finish.\"\n\n### 4. Optimize for Efficiency and Delight\n\nRefine flows for optimal user experience:\n\"**Flow Optimization:**\nFor each journey, let's ensure we're:\n\n- Minimizing steps to value (getting users to success quickly)\n- Reducing cognitive load at each decision point\n- Providing clear feedback and progress indicators\n- Creating moments of delight or accomplishment\n- Handling edge cases and error recovery gracefully\n\n**Specific Optimizations:**\n\n- [Optimization 1 for journey efficiency]\n- [Optimization 2 for user delight]\n- [Optimization 3 for error handling]\"\n\n### 5. Document Journey Patterns\n\nExtract reusable patterns across journeys:\n\"**Journey Patterns:**\nAcross these flows, I'm seeing some common patterns we can standardize:\n\n**Navigation Patterns:**\n\n- [Navigation pattern 1]\n- [Navigation pattern 2]\n\n**Decision Patterns:**\n\n- [Decision pattern 1]\n- [Decision pattern 2]\n\n**Feedback Patterns:**\n\n- [Feedback pattern 1]\n- [Feedback pattern 2]\n\nThese patterns will ensure consistency across all user experiences.\"\n\n### 6. Generate User Journey Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### [Journey 1 Name]\n\n[Journey 1 description and Mermaid diagram]\n\n### [Journey 2 Name]\n\n[Journey 2 description and Mermaid diagram]\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n[Journey patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n[Flow optimization principles based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated user journey content and present choices:\n\"I've designed detailed user journey flows for {{project_name}}. These flows will guide the detailed design of each user interaction.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our user journey designs\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on user flows\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to component strategy\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current user journey content\n- Process the enhanced journey insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the user journeys? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current user journeys\n- Process the collaborative journey insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the user journeys? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n- Load `./step-11-component-strategy.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Critical user journeys identified and designed\n✅ Detailed flow diagrams created for each journey\n✅ Flows optimized for efficiency and user delight\n✅ Common journey patterns extracted and documented\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not identifying all critical user journeys\n❌ Flows too complex or not optimized for user success\n❌ Missing error recovery paths\n❌ Not extracting reusable patterns across journeys\n❌ Flow diagrams unclear or incomplete\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-11-component-strategy.md` to define component library strategy.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-11 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Analyze Design System Coverage\n\nReview what components are available vs. needed:\n\"Based on our chosen design system [design system from step 6], let's identify what components are already available and what we need to create custom.\n\n**Available from Design System:**\n[List of components available in chosen design system]\n\n**Components Needed for {{project_name}}:**\nLooking at our user journeys and design direction, we need:\n\n- [Component need 1 from journey analysis]\n- [Component need 2 from design requirements]\n- [Component need 3 from core experience]\n\n**Gap Analysis:**\n\n- [Gap 1 - needed but not available]\n- [Gap 2 - needed but not available]\"\n\n### 2. Design Custom Components\n\nFor each custom component needed, design thoroughly:\n\n**For each custom component:**\n\"**[Component Name] Design:**\n\n**Purpose:** What does this component do for users?\n**Content:** What information or data does it display?\n**Actions:** What can users do with this component?\n**States:** What different states does it have? (default, hover, active, disabled, error, etc.)\n**Variants:** Are there different sizes or styles needed?\n**Accessibility:** What ARIA labels and keyboard support needed?\n\nLet's walk through each custom component systematically.\"\n\n### 3. Document Component Specifications\n\nCreate detailed specifications for each component:\n\n**Component Specification Template:**\n\n```markdown\n### [Component Name]\n\n**Purpose:** [Clear purpose statement]\n**Usage:** [When and how to use]\n**Anatomy:** [Visual breakdown of parts]\n**States:** [All possible states with descriptions]\n**Variants:** [Different sizes/styles if applicable]\n**Accessibility:** [ARIA labels, keyboard navigation]\n**Content Guidelines:** [What content works best]\n**Interaction Behavior:** [How users interact]\n```\n\n### 4. Define Component Strategy\n\nEstablish overall component library approach:\n\"**Component Strategy:**\n\n**Foundation Components:** (from design system)\n\n- [Foundation component 1]\n- [Foundation component 2]\n\n**Custom Components:** (designed in this step)\n\n- [Custom component 1 with rationale]\n- [Custom component 2 with rationale]\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n\n- Build custom components using design system tokens\n- Ensure consistency with established patterns\n- Follow accessibility best practices\n- Create reusable patterns for common use cases\"\n\n### 5. Plan Implementation Roadmap\n\nDefine how and when to build components:\n\"**Implementation Roadmap:**\n\n**Phase 1 - Core Components:**\n\n- [Component 1] - needed for [critical flow]\n- [Component 2] - needed for [critical flow]\n\n**Phase 2 - Supporting Components:**\n\n- [Component 3] - enhances [user experience]\n- [Component 4] - supports [design pattern]\n\n**Phase 3 - Enhancement Components:**\n\n- [Component 5] - optimizes [user journey]\n- [Component 6] - adds [special feature]\n\nThis roadmap helps prioritize development based on user journey criticality.\"\n\n### 6. Generate Component Strategy Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\n[Analysis of available design system components based on conversation]\n\n### Custom Components\n\n[Custom component specifications based on conversation]\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n[Component implementation strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n[Implementation roadmap based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated component strategy content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the component strategy for {{project_name}}. This balances using proven design system components with custom components for your unique needs.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our component strategy\n[P] Party Mode - Bring technical perspectives on component design\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to UX patterns\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current component strategy content\n- Process the enhanced component insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the component strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current component strategy\n- Process the collaborative component insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the component strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`\n- Load `./step-12-ux-patterns.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Design system coverage properly analyzed\n✅ All custom components thoroughly specified\n✅ Component strategy clearly defined\n✅ Implementation roadmap prioritized by user need\n✅ Accessibility considered for all components\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not analyzing design system coverage properly\n❌ Custom components not thoroughly specified\n❌ Missing accessibility considerations\n❌ Component strategy not aligned with user journeys\n❌ Implementation roadmap not prioritized effectively\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-12-ux-patterns.md` to define UX consistency patterns.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-12 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify Pattern Categories\n\nDetermine which patterns need definition for your product:\n\"Let's establish consistency patterns for how {{project_name}} behaves in common situations.\n\n**Pattern Categories to Define:**\n\n- Button hierarchy and actions\n- Feedback patterns (success, error, warning, info)\n- Form patterns and validation\n- Navigation patterns\n- Modal and overlay patterns\n- Empty states and loading states\n- Search and filtering patterns\n\nWhich categories are most critical for your product? We can go through each thoroughly or focus on the most important ones.\"\n\n### 2. Define Critical Patterns First\n\nFocus on patterns most relevant to your product:\n\n**For [Critical Pattern Category]:**\n\"**[Pattern Type] Patterns:**\nWhat should users see/do when they need to [pattern action]?\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- Visual hierarchy (primary vs. secondary actions)\n- Feedback mechanisms\n- Error recovery\n- Accessibility requirements\n- Mobile vs. desktop considerations\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- [Example 1 for this pattern type]\n- [Example 2 for this pattern type]\n\nHow should {{project_name}} handle [pattern type] interactions?\"\n\n### 3. Establish Pattern Guidelines\n\nDocument specific design decisions:\n\n**Pattern Guidelines Template:**\n\n```markdown\n### [Pattern Type]\n\n**When to Use:** [Clear usage guidelines]\n**Visual Design:** [How it should look]\n**Behavior:** [How it should interact]\n**Accessibility:** [A11y requirements]\n**Mobile Considerations:** [Mobile-specific needs]\n**Variants:** [Different states or styles if applicable]\n```\n\n### 4. Design System Integration\n\nEnsure patterns work with chosen design system:\n\"**Integration with [Design System]:**\n\n- How do these patterns complement our design system components?\n- What customizations are needed?\n- How do we maintain consistency while meeting unique needs?\n\n**Custom Pattern Rules:**\n\n- [Custom rule 1]\n- [Custom rule 2]\n- [Custom rule 3]\"\n\n### 5. Create Pattern Documentation\n\nGenerate comprehensive pattern library:\n\n**Pattern Library Structure:**\n\n- Clear usage guidelines for each pattern\n- Visual examples and specifications\n- Implementation notes for developers\n- Accessibility checklists\n- Mobile-first considerations\n\n### 6. Generate UX Patterns Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n[Button hierarchy patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n[Feedback patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n[Form patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n[Navigation patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n[Additional patterns based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated UX patterns content and present choices:\n\"I've established UX consistency patterns for {{project_name}}. These patterns ensure users have a consistent, predictable experience across all interactions.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our UX patterns\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on consistency patterns\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to responsive design\n\n### 8.

Define Responsive Strategy\n\nEstablish how the design adapts across devices:\n\"Let's define how {{project_name}} adapts across different screen sizes and devices.\n\n**Responsive Design Questions:**\n\n**Desktop Strategy:**\n\n- How should we use extra screen real estate?\n- Multi-column layouts, side navigation, or content density?\n- What desktop-specific features can we include?\n\n**Tablet Strategy:**\n\n- Should we use simplified layouts or touch-optimized interfaces?\n- How do gestures and touch interactions work on tablets?\n- What's the optimal information density for tablet screens?\n\n**Mobile Strategy:**\n\n- Bottom navigation or hamburger menu?\n- How do layouts collapse on small screens?\n- What's the most critical information to show mobile-first?\"\n\n### 2. Establish Breakpoint Strategy\n\nDefine when and how layouts change:\n\"**Breakpoint Strategy:**\nWe need to define screen size breakpoints where layouts adapt.\n\n**Common Breakpoints:**\n\n- Mobile: 320px - 767px\n- Tablet: 768px - 1023px\n- Desktop: 1024px+\n\n**For {{project_name}}, should we:**\n\n- Use standard breakpoints or custom ones?\n- Focus on mobile-first or desktop-first design?\n- Have specific breakpoints for your key use cases?\"\n\n### 3. Design Accessibility Strategy\n\nDefine accessibility requirements and compliance level:\n\"**Accessibility Strategy:**\nWhat level of WCAG compliance does {{project_name}} need?\n\n**WCAG Levels:**\n\n- **Level A (Basic)** - Essential accessibility for legal compliance\n- **Level AA (Recommended)** - Industry standard for good UX\n- **Level AAA (Highest)** - Exceptional accessibility (rarely needed)\n\n**Based on your product:**\n\n- [Recommendation based on user base, legal requirements, etc.]\n\n**Key Accessibility Considerations:**\n\n- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)\n- Keyboard navigation support\n- Screen reader compatibility\n- Touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)\n- Focus indicators and skip links\"\n\n### 4. Define Testing Strategy\n\nPlan how to ensure responsive design and accessibility:\n\"**Testing Strategy:**\n\n**Responsive Testing:**\n\n- Device testing on actual phones/tablets\n- Browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\n- Real device network performance testing\n\n**Accessibility Testing:**\n\n- Automated accessibility testing tools\n- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)\n- Keyboard-only navigation testing\n- Color blindness simulation testing\n\n**User Testing:**\n\n- Include users with disabilities in testing\n- Test with diverse assistive technologies\n- Validate with actual target devices\"\n\n### 5. Document Implementation Guidelines\n\nCreate specific guidelines for developers:\n\"**Implementation Guidelines:**\n\n**Responsive Development:**\n\n- Use relative units (rem, %, vw, vh) over fixed pixels\n- Implement mobile-first media queries\n- Test touch targets and gesture areas\n- Optimize images and assets for different devices\n\n**Accessibility Development:**\n\n- Semantic HTML structure\n- ARIA labels and roles\n- Keyboard navigation implementation\n- Focus management and skip links\n- High contrast mode support\"\n\n### 6. Generate Responsive & Accessibility Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n[Responsive strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n[Breakpoint strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n[Accessibility strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n[Testing strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n[Implementation guidelines based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated responsive and accessibility content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the responsive design and accessibility strategy for {{project_name}}. This ensures your product works beautifully across all devices and is accessible to all users.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our responsive/accessibility strategy\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on inclusive design\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and complete the workflow\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/tasks/advanced-elicitation.xml with the current responsive/accessibility content\n- Process the enhanced insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the responsive/accessibility strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/\\_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current responsive/accessibility strategy\n- Process the collaborative insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the responsive/accessibility strategy?
