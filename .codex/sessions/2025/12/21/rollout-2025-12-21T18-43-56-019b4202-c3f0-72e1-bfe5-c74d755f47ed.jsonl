Creates detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.'\nweb_bundle: true\n---\n\n# Create Epics and Stories\n\n**Goal:** Transform PRD requirements and Architecture decisions into comprehensive stories organized by user value, creating detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.\n\n**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a product strategist and technical specifications writer collaborating with a product owner. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring expertise in requirements decomposition, technical implementation context, and acceptance criteria writing, while the user brings their product vision, user needs, and business requirements. Work together as equals.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/\\_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/steps/step-01-validate-prerequisites.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Welcome and Overview\n\nWelcome {user_name} to comprehensive epic and story creation!\n\n**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE VALIDATION:**\n\nVerify required documents exist and are complete:\n\n1. **PRD.md** - Contains requirements (FRs and NFRs) and product scope\n2. **Architecture.md** - Contains technical decisions, API contracts, data models\n3. **UX Design.md** (if UI exists) - Contains interaction patterns, mockups, user flows\n\n### 2. Document Discovery and Validation\n\nSearch for required documents using these patterns (sharded means a large document was split into multiple small files with an index.md into a folder) - if the whole document is found, use that instead of the sharded version:\n\n**PRD Document Search Priority:**\n\n1. `{output_folder}/*prd*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{output_folder}/*prd*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\n**Architecture Document Search Priority:**\n\n1. `{output_folder}/*architecture*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{output_folder}/*architecture*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\n**UX Design Document Search (Optional):**\n\n1. `{output_folder}/*ux*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{output_folder}/*ux*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\nAsk the user if there are any other documents, or if what you have found is all there is [Yes/No]. Wait for user confirmation. Once confirmed, create the {outputFile} from the {epicsTemplate} and in the front matter list the files in the array of `inputDocuments: []`.\n\n### 3. Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nFrom the PRD document (full or sharded), extract ALL functional requirements:\n\n**Extraction Method:**\n\n- Look for numbered items like \"FR1:\", \"Functional Requirement 1:\", or similar\n- Identify requirement statements that describe what the system must DO\n- Include user actions, system behaviors, and business rules\n\n**Format the FR list as:**\n\n```\nFR1: [Clear, testable requirement description]\nFR2: [Clear, testable requirement description]\n...\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nFrom the PRD document, extract ALL non-functional requirements:\n\n**Extraction Method:**\n\n- Look for performance, security, usability, reliability requirements\n- Identify constraints and quality attributes\n- Include technical standards and compliance requirements\n\n**Format the NFR list as:**\n\n```\nNFR1: [Performance/Security/Usability requirement]\nNFR2: [Performance/Security/Usability requirement]\n...\n```\n\n### 5. Extract Additional Requirements from Architecture\n\nReview the Architecture document for technical requirements that impact epic and story creation:\n\n**Look for:**\n\n- **Starter Template**: Does Architecture specify a starter/greenfield template? If YES, document this for Epic 1 Story 1\n- Infrastructure and deployment requirements\n- Integration requirements with external systems\n- Data migration or setup requirements\n- Monitoring and logging requirements\n- API versioning or compatibility requirements\n- Security implementation requirements\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If a starter template is mentioned in Architecture, note it prominently. This will impact Epic 1 Story 1.\n\n**Format Additional Requirements as:**\n\n```\n- [Technical requirement from Architecture that affects implementation]\n- [Infrastructure setup requirement]\n- [Integration requirement]\n...\n```\n\n### 6. Extract Additional Requirements from UX (if exists)\n\nReview the UX document for requirements that affect epic and story creation:\n\n**Look for:**\n\n- Responsive design requirements\n- Accessibility requirements\n- Browser/device compatibility\n- User interaction patterns that need implementation\n- Animation or transition requirements\n- Error handling UX requirements\n\n**Add these to Additional Requirements list.**\n\n### 7. Load and Initialize Template\n\nLoad {epicsTemplate} and initialize {outputFile}:\n\n1. Copy the entire template to {outputFile}\n2. Replace {{project_name}} with the actual project name\n3. Replace placeholder sections with extracted requirements:\n   - {{fr_list}} → extracted FRs\n   - {{nfr_list}} → extracted NFRs\n   - {{additional_requirements}} → extracted additional requirements\n4. Leave {{requirements_coverage_map}} and {{epics_list}} as placeholders for now\n\n### 8. Present Extracted Requirements\n\nDisplay to user:\n\n**Functional Requirements Extracted:**\n\n- Show count of FRs found\n- Display the first few FRs as examples\n- Ask if any FRs are missing or incorrectly captured\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Extracted:**\n\n- Show count of NFRs found\n- Display key NFRs\n- Ask if any constraints were missed\n\n**Additional Requirements:**\n\n- Summarize technical requirements from Architecture\n- Summarize UX requirements (if applicable)\n- Verify completeness\n\n### 9. Get User Confirmation\n\nAsk: \"Do these extracted requirements accurately represent what needs to be built? Any additions or corrections?\"\n\nUpdate the requirements based on user feedback until confirmation is received.\n\n## CONTENT TO SAVE TO DOCUMENT:\n\nAfter extraction and confirmation, update {outputFile} with:\n\n- Complete FR list in {{fr_list}} section\n- Complete NFR list in {{nfr_list}} section\n- All additional requirements in {{additional_requirements}} section\n\n### 10. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: `**Confirm the Requirements are complete and correct to [C] continue:**`\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu option\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save all to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#10-present-menu-options)\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and all requirements are saved to document and frontmatter is updated, will you then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} to execute and begin epic design step.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All required documents found and validated\n- All FRs extracted and formatted correctly\n- All NFRs extracted and formatted correctly\n- Additional requirements from Architecture/UX identified\n- Template initialized with requirements\n- User confirms requirements are complete and accurate\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Missing required documents\n- Incomplete requirements extraction\n- Template not properly initialized\n- Not saving requirements to output file\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR1: Admin can create user accounts.

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement Auth.js + JWT sessions\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nWarm, human-readable pairing optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Fraunces` (expressive, travel-journal feel)\n- Body: `Source Serif 4` (highly readable long-form)\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative; CTA and title are focusable.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Keep latest entry preview under 2 lines.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap preview opens latest entry.\n\n### Timeline Entry Card\n\n**Purpose:** Enable fast scanning and navigation through the trip.  \n**Usage:** Timeline list and search results.  \n**Anatomy:** Thumbnail/media strip, title, date, location, short summary.  \n**States:** Default, hover, selected, unread/new.  \n**Variants:** Compact (list), rich (media-heavy).  \n**Accessibility:** Entire card is a link; ensure visible focus state.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Summary capped at 120 chars.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap to open entry detail.\n\n### Trip Switcher Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Switch between trips without confusion.  \n**Usage:** Global navigation.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip list with cover thumb, dates, last updated.  \n**States:** Default, selected, empty.  \n**Variants:** Drawer (mobile), popover (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation through list items.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting a trip returns to its latest entry.\n\n### Entry Reader\n\n**Purpose:** Long-form reading with immersive media.  \n**Usage:** Entry detail view.  \n**Anatomy:** Title, meta, media gallery, text body, map snippet.  \n**States:** Default, loading, error.  \n**Variants:** Read-only, contributor-editable.  \n**Accessibility:** Type size 17-18px minimum; skip-to-content.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Scrollable story, sticky top bar for navigation.\n\n### Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Keep spatial context while browsing entries.  \n**Usage:** Trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Map with pins + timeline list.  \n**States:** Default, selected pin, no location data.  \n**Variants:** Side-by-side (desktop), stacked (mobile).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard pin navigation; map has list alternative.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting pin highlights timeline entry.\n\n### Share/Invite Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Enable viewer access without friction.  \n**Usage:** Trip settings/share.  \n**Anatomy:** Share link, copy button, invite fields (optional).  \n**States:** Default, copied, error.  \n**Variants:** Minimal (link only), full (invite list).  \n**Accessibility:** Clear labels and focus feedback.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Copy link shows success state.\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Build custom components on top of design system tokens.\n- Keep core controls consistent with system defaults.\n- Prioritize accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation).\n- Use shared layout primitives for spacing consistency.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (Core Journeys):**\n- Active Trip Hero\n- Timeline Entry Card\n- Entry Reader\n\n**Phase 2 (Navigation + Context):**\n- Trip Switcher Panel\n- Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Phase 3 (Sharing):**\n- Share/Invite Panel\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**When to Use:** Primary for the single most important action; secondary for supportive actions; destructive only when necessary.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Primary: Teal filled buttons  \n- Secondary: Ghost style (text + subtle hover)  \n- Destructive: Clay red with clear label  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Only one primary action per view  \n- Destructive actions require confirm modal  \n**Accessibility:** Clear focus states and minimum 44px touch targets  \n**Mobile Considerations:** Primary action anchored near thumb-reach when possible\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Trip creation, entry creation/editing, sharing.  \n**Visual Design:** Labels above fields with asterisk for required fields.  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Inline validation as users type  \n- Errors appear below field with gentle, human language  \n- Submit disabled until required fields are valid  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Associate labels/inputs  \n- Error text announced by screen readers  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Large tap targets and clear spacing between inputs\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Global navigation, trip switching, entry browsing.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Desktop: Sidebar navigation with hamburger menu  \n- Mobile: Bottom button bar for primary sections  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Latest entry is visible on entry, but no persistent CTA  \n- Trips are always accessible via the nav  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Keyboard support for sidebar menu  \n- Clear active state indicator  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Bottom bar stays visible during scrolling\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop:** Map + timeline side-by-side for maximum context.\n- **Tablet:** Stacked layout (map above timeline) to keep reading simple.\n- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with bottom navigation for primary sections.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- **Mobile:** <768px  \n- **Tablet:** 768-1023px  \n- **Desktop:** 1024px+\n\nMobile-first layout with progressive enhancement for larger screens.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- Target **WCAG AA** compliance.\n- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.\n- Visible focus states for all interactive elements.\n- Minimum 44x44px touch targets.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Basic accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast checks.\n- Responsive device checks across mobile/tablet/desktop in major browsers.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary.\n- Support keyboard navigation for menus and drawers.\n- Keep line lengths and spacing optimized for readability.\n- Avoid hover-only interactions; ensure touch parity.\n"}}

Review Extracted Requirements\n\nLoad {outputFile} and review:\n\n- **Functional Requirements:** Count and review FRs from Step 1\n- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Review NFRs that need to be addressed\n- **Additional Requirements:** Review technical and UX requirements\n\n### 2. Explain Epic Design Principles\n\n**EPIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**\n\n1. **User-Value First**: Each epic must enable users to accomplish something meaningful\n2. **Requirements Grouping**: Group related FRs that deliver cohesive user outcomes\n3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each epic should deliver value independently\n4. **Logical Flow**: Natural progression from user's perspective\n5. **🔗 Dependency-Free Within Epic**: Stories within an epic must NOT depend on future stories\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**\nOrganize by USER VALUE, not technical layers:\n\n**✅ CORRECT Epic Examples (Standalone & Enable Future Epics):**\n\n- Epic 1: User Authentication & Profiles (users can register, login, manage profiles) - **Standalone: Complete auth system**\n- Epic 2: Content Creation (users can create, edit, publish content) - **Standalone: Uses auth, creates content**\n- Epic 3: Social Interaction (users can follow, comment, like content) - **Standalone: Uses auth + content**\n- Epic 4: Search & Discovery (users can find content and other users) - **Standalone: Uses all previous**\n\n**❌ WRONG Epic Examples (Technical Layers or Dependencies):**\n\n- Epic 1: Database Setup (creates all tables upfront) - **No user value**\n- Epic 2: API Development (builds all endpoints) - **No user value**\n- Epic 3: Frontend Components (creates reusable components) - **No user value**\n- Epic 4: Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD setup) - **No user value**\n\n**🔗 DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n\n- Each epic must deliver COMPLETE functionality for its domain\n- Epic 2 must not require Epic 3 to function\n- Epic 3 can build upon Epic 1 & 2 but must stand alone\n\n### 3. Design Epic Structure Collaboratively\n\n**Step A: Identify User Value Themes**\n\n- Look for natural groupings in the FRs\n- Identify user journeys or workflows\n- Consider user types and their goals\n\n**Step B: Propose Epic Structure**\nFor each proposed epic:\n\n1. **Epic Title**: User-centric, value-focused\n2. **User Outcome**: What users can accomplish after this epic\n3. **FR Coverage**: Which FR numbers this epic addresses\n4. **Implementation Notes**: Any technical or UX considerations\n\n**Step C: Create the epics_list**\n\nFormat the epics_list as:\n\n```\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: [Epic Title]\n[Epic goal statement - what users can accomplish]\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.\n\n### Epic 2: [Epic Title]\n[Epic goal statement - what users can accomplish]\n**FRs covered:** FR4, FR5, FR6, etc.\n\n[Continue for all epics]\n```\n\n### 4. Present Epic List for Review\n\nDisplay the complete epics_list to user with:\n\n- Total number of epics\n- FR coverage per epic\n- User value delivered by each epic\n- Any natural dependencies\n\n### 5. Create Requirements Coverage Map\n\nCreate {{requirements_coverage_map}} showing how each FR maps to an epic:\n\n```\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - [Brief description]\nFR2: Epic 1 - [Brief description]\nFR3: Epic 2 - [Brief description]\n...\n```\n\nThis ensures no FRs are missed.\n\n### 6. Collaborative Refinement\n\nAsk user:\n\n- \"Does this epic structure align with your product vision?\"\n- \"Are all user outcomes properly captured?\"\n- \"Should we adjust any epic groupings?\"\n- \"Are there natural dependencies we've missed?\"\n\n### 7. Get Final Approval\n\n**CRITICAL:** Must get explicit user approval:\n\"Do you approve this epic structure for proceeding to story creation?\"\n\nIf user wants changes:\n\n- Make the requested adjustments\n- Update the epics_list\n- Re-present for approval\n- Repeat until approval is received\n\n## CONTENT TO UPDATE IN DOCUMENT:\n\nAfter approval, update {outputFile}:\n\n1. Replace {{epics_list}} placeholder with the approved epic list\n2. Replace {{requirements_coverage_map}} with the coverage map\n3. Ensure all FRs are mapped to epics\n\n### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: \"**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}\n- IF C: Save approved epics_list to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#8-present-menu-options)\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution completes, redisplay the menu\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond when conversation ends, redisplay the menu options\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and the approved epics_list is saved to document, will you then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} to execute and begin story creation step.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Epics designed around user value\n- All FRs mapped to specific epics\n- epics_list created and formatted correctly\n- Requirements coverage map completed\n- User gives explicit approval for epic structure\n- Document updated with approved epics\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Epics organized by technical layers\n- Missing FRs in coverage map\n- No user approval obtained\n- epics_list not saved to document\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

Load Approved Epic Structure\n\nLoad {outputFile} and review:\n\n- Approved epics_list from Step 2\n- FR coverage map\n- All requirements (FRs, NFRs, additional)\n- Template structure at the end of the document\n\n### 2. Explain Story Creation Approach\n\n**STORY CREATION GUIDELINES:**\n\nFor each epic, create stories that:\n\n- Follow the exact template structure\n- Are sized for single dev agent completion\n- Have clear user value\n- Include specific acceptance criteria\n- Reference requirements being fulfilled\n\n**🚨 DATABASE/ENTITY CREATION PRINCIPLE:**\nCreate tables/entities ONLY when needed by the story:\n\n- ❌ WRONG: Epic 1 Story 1 creates all 50 database tables\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each story creates/alters ONLY the tables it needs\n\n**🔗 STORY DEPENDENCY PRINCIPLE:**\nStories must be independently completable in sequence:\n\n- ❌ WRONG: Story 1.2 requires Story 1.3 to be completed first\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each story can be completed based only on previous stories\n- ❌ WRONG: \"Wait for Story 1.4 to be implemented before this works\"\n- ✅ RIGHT: \"This story works independently and enables future stories\"\n\n**STORY FORMAT (from template):**\n\n```\n### Story {N}.{M}: {story_title}\n\nAs a {user_type},\nI want {capability},\nSo that {value_benefit}.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** {precondition}\n**When** {action}\n**Then** {expected_outcome}\n**And** {additional_criteria}\n```\n\n**✅ GOOD STORY EXAMPLES:**\n\n_Epic 1: User Authentication_\n\n- Story 1.1: User Registration with Email\n- Story 1.2: User Login with Password\n- Story 1.3: Password Reset via Email\n\n_Epic 2: Content Creation_\n\n- Story 2.1: Create New Blog Post\n- Story 2.2: Edit Existing Blog Post\n- Story 2.3: Publish Blog Post\n\n**❌ BAD STORY EXAMPLES:**\n\n- Story: \"Set up database\" (no user value)\n- Story: \"Create all models\" (too large, no user value)\n- Story: \"Build authentication system\" (too large)\n- Story: \"Login UI (depends on Story 1.3 API endpoint)\" (future dependency!)\n- Story: \"Edit post (requires Story 1.4 to be implemented first)\" (wrong order!)\n\n### 3. Process Epics Sequentially\n\nFor each epic in the approved epics_list:\n\n#### A. Epic Overview\n\nDisplay:\n\n- Epic number and title\n- Epic goal statement\n- FRs covered by this epic\n- Any NFRs or additional requirements relevant\n\n#### B. Story Breakdown\n\nWork with user to break down the epic into stories:\n\n- Identify distinct user capabilities\n- Ensure logical flow within the epic\n- Size stories appropriately\n\n#### C. Generate Each Story\n\nFor each story in the epic:\n\n1. **Story Title**: Clear, action-oriented\n2. **User Story**: Complete the As a/I want/So that format\n3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Write specific, testable criteria\n\n**AC Writing Guidelines:**\n\n- Use Given/When/Then format\n- Each AC should be independently testable\n- Include edge cases and error conditions\n- Reference specific requirements when applicable\n\n#### D. Collaborative Review\n\nAfter writing each story:\n\n- Present the story to user\n- Ask: \"Does this story capture the requirement correctly?\"\n- \"Is the scope appropriate for a single dev session?\"\n- \"Are the acceptance criteria complete and testable?\"\n\n#### E. Append to Document\n\nWhen story is approved:\n\n- Append it to {outputFile} following template structure\n- Use correct numbering (Epic N, Story M)\n- Maintain proper markdown formatting\n\n### 4. Epic Completion\n\nAfter all stories for an epic are complete:\n\n- Display epic summary\n- Show count of stories created\n- Verify all FRs for the epic are covered\n- Get user confirmation to proceed to next epic\n\n### 5. Repeat for All Epics\n\nContinue the process for each epic in the approved list, processing them in order (Epic 1, Epic 2, etc.).\n\n### 6. Final Document Completion\n\nAfter all epics and stories are generated:\n\n- Verify the document follows template structure exactly\n- Ensure all placeholders are replaced\n- Confirm all FRs are covered\n- Check formatting consistency\n\n## TEMPLATE STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE:\n\nThe final {outputFile} must follow this structure exactly:\n\n1. **Overview** section with project name\n2. **Requirements Inventory** with all three subsections populated\n3. **FR Coverage Map** showing requirement to epic mapping\n4. **Epic List** with approved epic structure\n5. **Epic sections** for each epic (N = 1, 2, 3...)\n   - Epic title and goal\n   - All stories for that epic (M = 1, 2, 3...)\n     - Story title and user story\n     - Acceptance Criteria using Given/When/Then format\n\n### 7. Present FINAL MENU OPTIONS\n\nAfter all epics and stories are complete:\n\nDisplay: \"**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}\n- IF C: Save content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#7-present-final-menu-options)\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu options\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [all epics and stories saved to document following the template structure exactly], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin final validation phase.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All epics processed in sequence\n- Stories created for each epic\n- Template structure followed exactly\n- All FRs covered by stories\n- Stories appropriately sized\n- Acceptance criteria are specific and testable\n- Document is complete and ready for development\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Deviating from template structure\n- Missing epics or stories\n- Stories too large or unclear\n- Missing acceptance criteria\n- Not following proper formatting\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

FR Coverage Validation\n\nReview the complete epic and story breakdown to ensure EVERY FR is covered:\n\n**CRITICAL CHECK:**\n\n- Go through each FR from the Requirements Inventory\n- Verify it appears in at least one story\n- Check that acceptance criteria fully address the FR\n- No FRs should be left uncovered\n\n### 2. Architecture Implementation Validation\n\n**Check for Starter Template Setup:**\n\n- Does Architecture document specify a starter template?\n- If YES: Epic 1 Story 1 must be \"Set up initial project from starter template\"\n- This includes cloning, installing dependencies, initial configuration\n\n**Database/Entity Creation Validation:**\n\n- Are database tables/entities created ONLY when needed by stories?\n- ❌ WRONG: Epic 1 creates all tables upfront\n- ✅ RIGHT: Tables created as part of the first story that needs them\n- Each story should create/modify ONLY what it needs\n\n### 3. Story Quality Validation\n\n**Each story must:**\n\n- Be completable by a single dev agent\n- Have clear acceptance criteria\n- Reference specific FRs it implements\n- Include necessary technical details\n- **Not have forward dependencies** (can only depend on PREVIOUS stories)\n- Be implementable without waiting for future stories\n\n### 4. Epic Structure Validation\n\n**Check that:**\n\n- Epics deliver user value, not technical milestones\n- Dependencies flow naturally\n- Foundation stories only setup what's needed\n- No big upfront technical work\n\n### 5. Dependency Validation (CRITICAL)\n\n**Epic Independence Check:**\n\n- Does each epic deliver COMPLETE functionality for its domain?\n- Can Epic 2 function without Epic 3 being implemented?\n- Can Epic 3 function standalone using Epic 1 & 2 outputs?\n- ❌ WRONG: Epic 2 requires Epic 3 features to work\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each epic is independently valuable\n\n**Within-Epic Story Dependency Check:**\nFor each epic, review stories in order:\n\n- Can Story N.1 be completed without Stories N.2, N.3, etc.?\n- Can Story N.2 be completed using only Story N.1 output?\n- Can Story N.3 be completed using only Stories N.1 & N.2 outputs?\n- ❌ WRONG: \"This story depends on a future story\"\n- ❌ WRONG: Story references features not yet implemented\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each story builds only on previous stories\n\n### 6. Complete and Save\n\nIf all validations pass:\n\n- Update any remaining placeholders in the document\n- Ensure proper formatting\n- Save the final epics.md\n\n**Present Final Menu:**\n**All validations complete!** [C] Complete Workflow\n\nWhen C is selected, the workflow is complete and the epics.md is ready for development.\n"}}
