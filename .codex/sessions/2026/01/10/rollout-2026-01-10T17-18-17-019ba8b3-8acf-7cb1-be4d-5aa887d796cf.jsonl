Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(Phase 2)\nFR2: Admin can assign a user role as creator or viewer. (Phase 2)\nFR3: System can authenticate users with email and password. (Phase 2)\nFR4: Creators can sign in and access their trips and entries. (Phase 2)\nFR5: Viewers can sign in and access trips they are allowed to view. (Phase 2)\nFR6: Creators can create trips. (Phase 1)\nFR7: Creators can edit trip metadata (name, dates, cover). (Phase 1)\nFR8: Creators can delete trips. (Phase 2)\nFR9: System can display a list of trips for a creator. (Phase 1)\nFR10: Creators can add a blog entry to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR11: Creators can edit a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR12: Creators can delete a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR13: Each entry can include a text body. (Phase 1)\nFR14: Each entry can include multiple media files. (Phase 1)\nFR15: System can display entries in a trip in chronological order. (Phase 1)\nFR16: Users can upload multiple media files in one entry. (Phase 1)\nFR17: System can display media-first entry pages. (Phase 1)\nFR18: System can show media in a gallery or carousel within an entry. (Phase 1)\nFR19: Creators can generate a shareable link to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR20: Anyone with the shareable link can view the trip. (Phase 1)\nFR21: Creators can invite specific users to a trip as viewers. (Phase 2)\nFR22: Creators can enable a viewer to contribute to a trip. (Phase 2)\nFR23: Viewers can view trips they are invited to. (Phase 2)\nFR24: Viewers with contribution enabled can add entries to that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR25: Viewers with contribution enabled can edit entries in that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR26: System can display a trip map view with entry locations. (Phase 3)\nFR27: System can display a timeline view tied to map locations. (Phase 3)\nFR28: System can extract coordinates from photo metadata. (Phase 3)\nFR29: Users can view a trip overview with latest entries. (Phase 1)\nFR30: Users can open an entry in a single-page view. (Phase 1)\nFR31: Users can navigate between entries in a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR32: Admin can manage user access and roles. (Phase 2)\nFR33: Admin can deactivate users. (Phase 2)\n\n### MVP Scope Adjustment\n\n- Lightweight authentication is required in MVP to protect creator trip/entry management.\n- This is a scope change from the PRD (which labels auth in Phase 2). Update the PRD when convenient.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Page load time is 5-10 seconds under typical home broadband.\nNFR2: Entry switching response time is under 1 second.\nNFR3: Trip switching response time is 2-5 seconds.\nNFR4: Media upload supports 10-15 files per entry under normal consumer bandwidth.\nNFR5: Use HTTPS for all traffic.\nNFR6: Store passwords using secure hashing when user management is introduced (Phase 2).\nNFR7: Shareable links are unguessable.\nNFR8: Support current versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.\nNFR9: Provide responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers.\nNFR10: Accessibility follows standard good practices (UX specifies WCAG AA).\nNFR11: SPA architecture with no multi-page app requirement.\nNFR12: No SEO requirement; app is private.\nNFR13: No real-time updates; viewers refresh to see new entries.\nNFR14: Optimize media loading and rendering to support fast entry switching.\nNFR15: Enforce role-based access on client and server.\nNFR16: Support small groups up to 15 viewers per trip.\nNFR17: Support low concurrency (2-3 concurrent viewers).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Starter: initialize with `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs` and select TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for styling.\n- Database: SQLite with Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast.\n- UX typography: Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body, body size 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars.\n- UX color tokens: warm terracotta primary, deep teal secondary, ivory/sand surfaces, charcoal text with defined semantic colors.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 5 - Admin creates users  \nFR2: Epic 5 - Role assignment  \nFR3: Epic 5 -

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user,\nI want to switch the application language between English and German,\nso that the entire UI and date/time formatting match my preference.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in\n   **When** I open the language selector\n   **Then** I can choose English or German\n2. **Given** I switch the language\n   **When** the UI re-renders\n   **Then** all visible text updates to the selected language\n3. **Given** I switch the language\n   **When** dates and times are rendered\n   **Then** they follow the locale format for the selected language\n4. **Given** I refresh the page or reopen the app\n   **When** my language preference was previously set\n   **Then** the app loads in that language\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Define i18n strategy and locale storage (AC: 1-4)\n  - [x] Store user preference in profile or local storage (pick one and document)\n  - [x] Establish translation keys for shared UI strings\n- [x] Add language selector UI (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Provide a language toggle or selector in a global location\n- [x] Localize UI content (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Ensure all user-facing strings route through the translation layer\n- [x] Localize date/time formatting (AC: 3)\n  - [x] Use locale-aware date/time formatting for EN/DE\n- [x] Persist and restore language preference (AC: 4)\n  - [x] Load stored language on app start and apply before rendering\n- [x] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [x] Component tests for language toggle and persisted preference\n  - [x] Utility tests for date/time formatting by locale\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- The UI currently renders static English strings; introduce a translation layer that can be reused across pages and components. [Source: travelblogs/src/app]\n- Date formatting is done with `toLocaleDateString` in several components; standardize locale usage based on the selected language. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx]\n- Keep locale formatting consistent with EN (`en-US`) and DE (`de-DE`).\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Supported locales: English and German only.\n- Language selection must update all visible UI strings without full page reload if feasible.\n- Date/time formatting must follow the selected locale (e.g., `en-US` vs `de-DE`).\n- Persist preference across sessions.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Selector should be clear and unobtrusive; match existing button/typography styling. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- Use short labels (e.g., EN / DE or English / Deutsch) and clear state indication.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; no external i18n framework unless approved.\n- Use TypeScript and central utilities for translation and formatting.\n- Avoid adding new top-level directories; use `utils/` for shared helpers.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite (no schema changes required unless storing preference in DB).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Translation utilities: `travelblogs/src/utils/`.\n- Selector UI placement: existing global layout or trip header as decided.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/` and `travelblogs/tests/utils/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - Language selector toggles UI text between EN and DE.\n  - Language preference persists after reload.\n- Utility tests:\n  - Date formatting outputs expected locale formats for EN/DE.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Role-based access and trip views already exist; do not break share-link views when switching language. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-5-invalidate-shared-entry-pages-on-revoke.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js session handling and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n-

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\\n\\n## Story\\n\\nAs a user,\\nI want all dates displayed in a consistent, locale-aware format,\\nso that dates are clear and uniform across the app.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. **Given** my language is English\\n   **When** a date is displayed anywhere in the UI\\n   **Then** it follows the format \\\"May 16th, 2024\\\" (full month name, ordinal day, comma, year)\\n2. **Given** my language is German\\n   **When** a date is displayed anywhere in the UI\\n   **Then** it follows the format \\\"16. Mai 2024\\\"\\n3. **Given** any date-only display (trip dates, entry dates, admin created dates, shared views)\\n   **When** the UI renders\\n   **Then** all date-only rendering uses the same shared formatting utility\\n4. **Given** date/time displays still exist\\n   **When** the UI renders date+time values\\n   **Then** they remain locale-aware and consistent with existing date-time formatting utilities\\n\\n## Tasks / Subtasks\\n\\n- [ ] Update shared date formatting utility to support the new English/German formats (AC: 1-2)\\n  - [ ] Implement English ordinal suffix logic (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th...; 11th-13th exceptions)\\n  - [ ] Use Intl/DateTimeFormat for locale month names and ordering\\n- [ ] Replace any inline date formatting with the shared utility (AC: 3)\\n  - [ ] Remove local `toLocaleDateString` usage in trip overview and use shared formatter\\n  - [ ] Verify entry/trip/admin views all call the shared formatter\\n- [ ] Update or add tests for date formatting and affected components (AC: 1-4)\\n  - [ ] Utility tests for English ordinals and German formatting\\n  - [ ] Component tests updated for new date strings\\n\\n## Dev Notes\\n\\n- A shared i18n utility already exists: `formatDate` in `travelblogs/src/utils/i18n.ts` and is surfaced via `useTranslation`. Update this to enforce the new date format consistently. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/i18n.ts]\\n- `TripOverview` currently formats dates locally with `toLocaleDateString`, which diverges from the shared utility and must be replaced. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-overview.tsx]\\n- Other date displays already use `formatDate` via `useTranslation`, so updating the utility should propagate the new format. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx]\\n- UX spec expects consistent date labeling in trip and entry surfaces. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- Date-only display format must be:\\n  - English: `MMMM D<ordinal>, YYYY` (e.g., \\\"May 16th, 2024\\\")\\n  - German: `D. MMMM YYYY` (e.g., \\\"16. Mai 2024\\\")\\n- Implement ordinal suffix logic for English dates with correct 11th-13th handling.\\n- Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` or `toLocaleDateString` with explicit options for month/day/year.\\n- Keep date-time formatting locale-aware and aligned with existing `formatDateTime` usage.\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- Use existing i18n utilities in `travelblogs/src/utils/` (no new libraries).\\n- Keep App Router conventions intact; avoid new top-level directories. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Use built-in Intl APIs only; do not add new date libraries.\\n- Preserve the `useTranslation` hook API and existing locale storage behavior. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/use-translation.ts]\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- Update date formatting logic in `travelblogs/src/utils/i18n.ts`.\\n- Replace inline formatting in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-overview.tsx`.\\n- Validate other components continue to use `formatDate` and `formatDateTime` from the shared utilities.\\n- Tests remain under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests). [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- Update `tests/utils/i18n.test.ts` to cover English ordinal and German formats.\\n- Update component tests that assert date strings (trip overview, entry reader/detail, admin user list).\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Language selection and locale-aware formatting utilities are already implemented (useTranslation, LocaleProvider). Build on these existing patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/6-5-language-selection.md]\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n\\n- Web research not performed due to restricted network access; use built-in Intl APIs and pinned project patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n\\n- All user-facing UI strings must be translatable and provided in both English and German. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\\n- Tests must live under `tests/` and follow existing conventions. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\\n\\n### Story Completion Status\\n\\n- Status: ready-for-dev\\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\\n\\n### Project Structure Notes\\n\\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\\n- Utilities live under `travelblogs/src/utils/`.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Epic and requirements context: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\\n- UX expectations: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\\n\\n## Dev Agent Record\\n\\n### Agent Model Used\\n\\nCodex (GPT-5)\\n\\n### Debug Log References\\n\\n### Completion Notes List\\n\\n- Created story for unified date formatting with EN ordinal and DE long-date formats.\\n- Identified shared formatter and inline overrides that must be unified.\\n- Flagged test updates required for the new date strings.\\n\\n### File List\\n\\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/6-4-date-formatting.md\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/i18n.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-overview.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-reader.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx\\n- travelblogs/tests/utils/i18n.test.ts\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_jAtYp3ndmd9l4bBKDZSGhKTR"}}

Your mission is to **thoroughly review** a story file that was generated by the create-story workflow and **systematically identify any mistakes, omissions, or disasters** that the original LLM missed.\n\n**Your purpose is NOT just to validate - it's to FIX and PREVENT LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n### **🚨 CRITICAL MISTAKES TO PREVENT:**\n\n- **Reinventing wheels** - Creating duplicate functionality instead of reusing existing\n- **Wrong libraries** - Using incorrect frameworks, versions, or dependencies\n- **Wrong file locations** - Violating project structure and organization\n- **Breaking regressions** - Implementing changes that break existing functionality\n- **Ignoring UX** - Not following user experience design requirements\n- **Vague implementations** - Creating unclear, ambiguous implementations\n- **Lying about completion** - Implementing incorrectly or incompletely\n- **Not learning from past work** - Ignoring previous story learnings and patterns\n\n### **🚨 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:**\n\nYou must thoroughly analyze **ALL artifacts** to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important quality control function in the entire development process!\n\n### **🔬 UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS:**\n\nUse research subagents, subprocesses, or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts **simultaneously and thoroughly**. Leave no stone unturned!\n\n### **🎯 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE:**\n\nThis is a COMPETITION to create the **ULTIMATE story context** that makes LLM developer mistakes **IMPOSSIBLE**!\n\n## **🚀 HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST**\n\n### **When Running from Create-Story Workflow:**\n\n- The `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml` framework will automatically:\n  - Load this checklist file\n  - Load the newly created story file (`{story_file_path}`)\n  - Load workflow variables from `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml`\n  - Execute the validation process\n\n### **When Running in Fresh Context:**\n\n- User should provide the story file path being reviewed\n- Load the story file directly\n- Load the corresponding workflow.yaml for variable context\n- Proceed with systematic analysis\n\n### **Required Inputs:**\n\n- **Story file**: The story file to review and improve\n- **Workflow variables**: From workflow.yaml (story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, etc.)\n- **Source documents**: Epics, architecture, etc. (discovered or provided)\n- **Validation framework**: `validate-workflow.xml` (handles checklist execution)\n\n---\n\n## **🔬 SYSTEMATIC RE-ANALYSIS APPROACH**\n\nYou will systematically re-do the entire story creation process, but with a critical eye for what the original LLM might have missed:\n\n### **Step 1: Load and Understand the Target**\n\n1. **Load the workflow configuration**: `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml` for variable inclusion\n2. **Load the story file**: `{story_file_path}` (provided by user or discovered)\n3. **Load validation framework**: `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml`\n4. **Extract metadata**: epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title from story file\n5. **Resolve all workflow variables**: story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, architecture_file, etc.\n6. **Understand current status**: What story implementation guidance is currently provided?\n\n**Note:** If running in fresh context, user should provide the story file path being reviewed. If running from create-story workflow, the validation framework will automatically discover the checklist and story file.\n\n### **Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis**\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Treat this like YOU are creating the story from scratch to PREVENT DISASTERS!**\n**Discover everything the original LLM missed that could cause developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n#### **2.1 Epics and Stories Analysis**\n\n- Load `{epics_file}` (or sharded equivalents)\n- Extract **COMPLETE Epic {{epic_num}} context**:\n  - Epic objectives and business value\n  - ALL stories in this epic (for cross-story context)\n  - Our specific story's requirements, acceptance criteria\n  - Technical requirements and constraints\n  - Cross-story dependencies and prerequisites\n\n#### **2.2 Architecture Deep-Dive**\n\n- Load `{architecture_file}` (single or sharded)\n- **Systematically scan for ANYTHING relevant to this story:**\n  - Technical stack with versions (languages, frameworks, libraries)\n  - Code structure and organization patterns\n  - API design patterns and contracts\n  - Database schemas and relationships\n  - Security requirements and patterns\n  - Performance requirements and optimization strategies\n  - Testing standards and frameworks\n  - Deployment and environment patterns\n  - Integration patterns and external services\n\n#### **2.3 Previous Story Intelligence (if applicable)**\n\n- If `story_num > 1`, load the previous story file\n- Extract **actionable intelligence**:\n  - Dev notes and learnings\n  - Review feedback and corrections needed\n  - Files created/modified and their patterns\n  - Testing approaches that worked/didn't work\n  - Problems encountered and solutions found\n  - Code patterns and conventions established\n\n#### **2.4 Git History Analysis (if available)**\n\n- Analyze recent commits for patterns:\n  - Files created/modified in previous work\n  - Code patterns and conventions used\n  - Library dependencies added/changed\n  - Architecture decisions implemented\n  - Testing approaches used\n\n#### **2.5 Latest Technical Research**\n\n- Identify any libraries/frameworks mentioned\n- Research latest versions and critical information:\n  - Breaking changes or security updates\n  - Performance improvements or deprecations\n  - Best practices for current versions\n\n### **Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis**\n\n**🚨 CRITICAL: Identify every mistake the original LLM missed that could cause DISASTERS!**\n\n#### **3.1 Reinvention Prevention Gaps**\n\n- **Wheel reinvention:** Areas where developer might create duplicate functionality\n- **Code reuse opportunities** not identified that could prevent redundant work\n- **Existing solutions** not mentioned that developer should extend instead of replace\n\n#### **3.2 Technical Specification DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong libraries/frameworks:** Missing version requirements that could cause compatibility issues\n- **API contract violations:** Missing endpoint specifications that could break integrations\n- **Database schema conflicts:** Missing requirements that could corrupt data\n- **Security vulnerabilities:** Missing security requirements that could expose the system\n- **Performance disasters:** Missing requirements that could cause system failures\n\n#### **3.3 File Structure DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong file locations:** Missing organization requirements that could break build processes\n- **Coding standard violations:** Missing conventions that could create inconsistent codebase\n- **Integration pattern breaks:** Missing data flow requirements that could cause system failures\n- **Deployment failures:** Missing environment requirements that could prevent deployment\n\n#### **3.4 Regression DISASTERS**\n\n- **Breaking changes:** Missing requirements that could break existing functionality\n- **Test failures:** Missing test requirements that could allow bugs to reach production\n- **UX violations:** Missing user experience requirements that could ruin the product\n- **Learning failures:** Missing previous story context that could repeat same mistakes\n\n#### **3.5 Implementation DISASTERS**\n\n- **Vague implementations:** Missing details that could lead to incorrect or incomplete work\n- **Completion lies:** Missing acceptance criteria that could allow fake implementations\n- **Scope creep:** Missing boundaries that could cause unnecessary work\n- **Quality failures:** Missing quality requirements that could deliver broken features\n\n### **Step 4: LLM-Dev-Agent Optimization Analysis**\n\n**CRITICAL STEP: Optimize story context for LLM developer agent consumption**\n\n**Analyze current story for LLM optimization issues:**\n\n- **Verbosity problems:** Excessive detail that wastes tokens without adding value\n- **Ambiguity issues:** Vague instructions that could lead to multiple interpretations\n- **Context overload:** Too much information not directly relevant to implementation\n- **Missing critical signals:** Key requirements buried in verbose text\n- **Poor structure:** Information not organized for efficient LLM processing\n\n**Apply LLM Optimization Principles:**\n\n- **Clarity over verbosity:** Be precise and direct, eliminate fluff\n- **Actionable instructions:** Every sentence should guide implementation\n- **Scannable structure:** Use clear headings, bullet points, and emphasis\n- **Token efficiency:** Pack maximum information into minimum text\n- **Unambiguous language:** Clear requirements with no room for interpretation\n\n### **Step 5: Improvement Recommendations**\n\n**For each gap identified, provide specific, actionable improvements:**\n\n#### **5.1 Critical Misses (Must Fix)**\n\n- Missing essential technical requirements\n- Missing previous story context that could cause errors\n- Missing anti-pattern prevention that could lead to duplicate code\n- Missing security or performance requirements\n\n#### **5.2 Enhancement Opportunities (Should Add)**\n\n- Additional architectural guidance that would help developer\n- More detailed technical specifications\n- Better code reuse opportunities\n- Enhanced testing guidance\n\n#### **5.3 Optimization Suggestions (Nice to Have)**\n\n- Performance optimization hints\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n- Enhanced debugging or development tips\n\n#### **5.4 LLM Optimization Improvements**\n\n- Token-efficient phrasing of existing content\n- Clearer structure for LLM processing\n- More actionable and direct instructions\n- Reduced verbosity while maintaining completeness\n\n---\n\n## **🎯 COMPETITION SUCCESS METRICS**\n\n**You WIN against the original LLM if you identify:**\n\n### **Category 1: Critical Misses (Blockers)**\n\n- Essential technical requirements the developer needs but aren't provided\n- Previous story learnings that would prevent errors if ignored\n- Anti-pattern prevention that would prevent code duplication\n- Security or performance requirements that must be followed\n\n### **Category 2: Enhancement Opportunities**\n\n- Architecture guidance that would significantly help implementation\n- Technical specifications that would prevent wrong approaches\n- Code reuse opportunities the developer should know about\n- Testing guidance that would improve quality\n\n### **Category 3: Optimization Insights**\n\n- Performance or efficiency improvements\n- Development workflow optimizations\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n\n---\n\n## **📋 INTERACTIVE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS**\n\nAfter completing your systematic analysis, present your findings to the user interactively:\n\n### **Step 5: Present Improvement Suggestions**\n\n```\n🎯 **STORY CONTEXT QUALITY REVIEW COMPLETE**\n\n**Story:** {{story_key}} - {{story_title}}\n\nI found {{critical_count}} critical issues, {{enhancement_count}} enhancements, and {{optimization_count}} optimizations.\n\n## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)**\n\n{{list each critical issue with clear, actionable description}}\n\n## **⚡ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Should Add)**\n\n{{list each enhancement with clear benefit description}}\n\n## **✨ OPTIMIZATIONS (Nice to Have)**\n\n{{list each optimization with benefit description}}\n\n## **🤖 LLM OPTIMIZATION (Token Efficiency & Clarity)**\n\n{{list each LLM optimization that will improve dev agent performance:\n- Reduce verbosity while maintaining completeness\n- Improve structure for better LLM processing\n- Make instructions more actionable and direct\n- Enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity}}\n```\n\n### **Step 6: Interactive User Selection**\n\nAfter presenting the suggestions, ask the user:\n\n```\n**IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\nWhich improvements would you like me to apply to the story?\n\n**Select from the numbered list above, or choose:**\n- **all** - Apply all suggested improvements\n- **critical** - Apply only critical issues\n- **select** - I'll choose specific numbers\n- **none** - Keep story as-is\n- **details** - Show me more details about any suggestion\n\nYour choice:\n```\n\n### **Step 7: Apply Selected Improvements**\n\nWhen user accepts improvements:\n\n- **Load the story file**\n- **Apply accepted changes** (make them look natural, as if they were always there)\n- **DO NOT reference** the review process, original LLM, or that changes were \"added\" or \"enhanced\"\n- **Ensure clean, coherent final story** that reads as if it was created perfectly the first time\n\n### **Step 8: Confirmation**\n\nAfter applying changes:\n\n```\n✅ **STORY IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED**\n\nUpdated {{count}} sections in the story file.\n\nThe story now includes comprehensive developer guidance to prevent common implementation issues and ensure flawless execution.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the updated story\n2. Run `dev-story` for implementation\n```\n\n---\n\n## **💪 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE MINDSET**\n\n**Your goal:** Improve the story file with dev agent needed context that makes flawless implementation inevitable while being optimized for LLM developer agent consumption. Remember the dev agent will ONLY have this file to use.\n\n**Success Criteria:** The LLM developer agent that processes your improved story will have:\n\n- ✅ Clear technical requirements they must follow\n- ✅ Previous work context they can build upon\n- ✅ Anti-pattern prevention to avoid common mistakes\n- ✅ Comprehensive guidance for efficient implementation\n- ✅ **Optimized content structure** for maximum clarity and minimum token waste\n- ✅ **Actionable instructions** with no ambiguity or verbosity\n- ✅ **Efficient information density** - maximum guidance in minimum text\n\n**Every improvement should make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer to:**\n\n- Reinvent existing solutions\n- Use wrong approaches or libraries\n- Create duplicate functionality\n- Miss critical requirements\n- Make implementation errors\n\n**LLM Optimization Should Make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer agent to:**\n\n- Misinterpret requirements due to ambiguity\n- Waste tokens on verbose, non-actionable content\n- Struggle to find critical information buried in text\n- Get confused by poor structure or organization\n- Miss key implementation signals due to inefficient communication\n\n**Go create the ultimate developer implementation guide! 🚀**\n"}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
