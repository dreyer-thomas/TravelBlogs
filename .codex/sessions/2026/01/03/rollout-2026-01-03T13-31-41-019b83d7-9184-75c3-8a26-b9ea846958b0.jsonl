[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\n- Entry pages currently check `trip.ownerId === session.user.id` and will block contributors; update to use `TripAccess` plus `canContributeToTrip` where needed. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx]\n- Entry detail actions always show edit/delete; ensure delete remains creator-only and edit is shown for contributors. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access helpers are centralized; avoid duplicating access queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Trip metadata edits currently check owner-only; update to allow contributors with `canContributeToTrip` while keeping delete owner-only. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Contributors can create and edit entries only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\n- View-only users may view entries but cannot access create/edit routes.\n- `DELETE /api/entries/:id` remains creator-only.\n- Contributors can edit trip metadata only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\n- `DELETE /api/trips/:id` remains creator-only.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Use centralized access helpers in `src/utils/` (no new `lib/`).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Trip API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/new/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`.\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n- Trip tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Contributors can create and edit entries for invited trips.\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on create/edit.\n  - Creators remain allowed for all entry actions; delete stays creator-only.\n  - Contributors can edit trip metadata for invited trips.\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on trip edit.\n- Component/page tests:\n  - Contributor sees edit action but not delete.\n  - View-only users do not see edit/delete actions.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and already updated entry APIs; focus on UI and page gating to match API rules. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n- Story 5.6 updated viewer trip access; keep view-only users read-only in entry flows. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added contributor access and viewer invites; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted contributor entry flow guidance focusing on UI gating and action visibility.\n- Reused existing contributor API checks and access helper patterns.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\n- Entry pages currently check `trip.ownerId === session.user.id` and will block contributors; update to use `TripAccess` plus `canContributeToTrip` where needed. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx]\n- Entry detail actions always show edit/delete; ensure delete remains creator-only and edit is shown for contributors. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access helpers are centralized; avoid duplicating access queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Trip metadata edits currently check owner-only; update to allow contributors with `canContributeToTrip` while keeping delete owner-only. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Contributors can create and edit entries only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\n- View-only users may view entries but cannot access create/edit routes.\n- `DELETE /api/entries/:id` remains creator-only.\n- Contributors can edit trip metadata only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\n- `DELETE /api/trips/:id` remains creator-only.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Use centralized access helpers in `src/utils/` (no new `lib/`).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Trip API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/new/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`.\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n- Trip tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Contributors can create and edit entries for invited trips.\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on create/edit.\n  - Creators remain allowed for all entry actions; delete stays creator-only.\n  - Contributors can edit trip metadata for invited trips.\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on trip edit.\n- Component/page tests:\n  - Contributor sees edit action but not delete.\n  - View-only users do not see edit/delete actions.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and already updated entry APIs; focus on UI and page gating to match API rules.
