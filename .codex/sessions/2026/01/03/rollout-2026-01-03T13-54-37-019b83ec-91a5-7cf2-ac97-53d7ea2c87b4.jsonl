Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user,\nI want to change my password at any time,\nso that I can keep my account secure.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in and provide my current password and a valid new password\n   **When** I submit the change password form\n   **Then** my password is updated securely\n   **And** I remain signed in with access to my trips\n2. **Given** I enter an incorrect current password or an invalid new password\n   **When** I submit the change password form\n   **Then** I see a clear error\n   **And** my password remains unchanged\n3. **Given** a user account is created by an admin\n   **When** that user signs in for the first time\n   **Then** they are required to change their password before accessing any trips\n4. **Given** I am required to change my password on first login\n   **When** I successfully update my password\n   **Then** the requirement is cleared\n   **And** I am redirected to my intended destination\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add first-login password change tracking (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Add `mustChangePassword` boolean to `User` (default `false` in migration)\n  - [ ] Set `mustChangePassword = true` when admin creates a user\n- [ ] Expose must-change state in auth session (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Extend `validateCredentials` to include `mustChangePassword` for DB users\n  - [ ] Add `mustChangePassword` to JWT + session callbacks and NextAuth typings\n- [ ] Add change password API (AC: 1, 2, 4)\n  - [ ] Add `PATCH /api/users/[id]/password` (self-service only)\n  - [ ] Validate payload with Zod: `{ currentPassword, newPassword }`\n  - [ ] Verify current password with bcryptjs; hash new password with cost 12\n  - [ ] On success, update `passwordHash` and set `mustChangePassword = false`\n- [ ] Enforce first-login flow (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Update middleware to redirect users with `mustChangePassword` to `/account/password`\n  - [ ] Allow access to `/account/password`, `/sign-in`, and auth APIs while gated\n- [ ] Add change password UI (AC: 1, 2, 4)\n  - [ ] Create `/account/password` page with current + new password fields\n  - [ ] Use warm palette + typography tokens; show clear validation messages\n  - [ ] On success, route to `callbackUrl` (default `/trips`)\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] API tests for change password success/failure and `mustChangePassword` clearing\n  - [ ] Auth tests for `validateCredentials` returning `mustChangePassword`\n  - [ ] Middleware tests for forced redirect to `/account/password`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Admin-created users currently receive a password via `POST /api/users`; extend this to mark `mustChangePassword` true without changing the creator-config flow. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- Credentials auth is implemented in `validateCredentials` with bcryptjs compare; keep hashing cost consistent (12). [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- The sign-in page already supports `callbackUrl`; reuse that for post-change redirect. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\n- Middleware currently only checks for authentication; extend it to gate `mustChangePassword` while allowing share routes and the change-password page. [Source: travelblogs/src/middleware.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- `PATCH /api/users/[id]/password` must only allow the authenticated user to change their own password.\n- Reject invalid payloads with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` and invalid current passwords with `403 FORBIDDEN`.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n- The legacy creator account defined via `.env` is out of scope for forced change (no `mustChangePassword` field).\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Keep the change password page consistent with the existing sign-in visual language (warm palette, rounded panels, focus rings). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\n- The forced-change state should clearly explain why the user must update their password and block other routes until complete. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and Prisma Migrate for the schema update.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- bcryptjs for password hashing/verification.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- API route: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts`.\n- Auth utils/types: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`, `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- Middleware: `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`.\n- UI: `travelblogs/src/app/account/password/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/users/` and `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/` plus middleware tests.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Successful password change updates hash and clears `mustChangePassword`.\n  - Incorrect current password returns `403` and does not update hash.\n  - Authenticated user cannot change another user's password.\n- Auth tests:\n  - `validateCredentials` returns `mustChangePassword` for DB users.\n- Middleware tests:\n  - Users with `mustChangePassword` are redirected to `/account/password` on protected routes.\n  - `/account/password` remains accessible while gated.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Epic 5 stories standardized role-based auth checks and `{ data, error }` responses; follow the same error contract for new auth routes.

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user,\nI want to change my password at any time,\nso that I can keep my account secure.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in and provide my current password and a valid new password\n   **When** I submit the change password form\n   **Then** my password is updated securely\n   **And** I remain signed in with access to my trips\n2. **Given** I enter an incorrect current password or an invalid new password\n   **When** I submit the change password form\n   **Then** I see a clear error\n   **And** my password remains unchanged\n3. **Given** a user account is created by an admin\n   **When** that user signs in for the first time\n   **Then** they are required to change their password before accessing any trips\n4. **Given** I am required to change my password on first login\n   **When** I successfully update my password\n   **Then** the requirement is cleared\n   **And** I am redirected to my intended destination\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add first-login password change tracking (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Add `mustChangePassword` boolean to `User` (default `false` in migration)\n  - [ ] Set `mustChangePassword = true` when admin creates a user\n- [ ] Expose must-change state in auth session (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Extend `validateCredentials` to include `mustChangePassword` for DB users\n  - [ ] Add `mustChangePassword` to JWT + session callbacks and NextAuth typings\n- [ ] Add change password API (AC: 1, 2, 4)\n  - [ ] Add `PATCH /api/users/[id]/password` (self-service only)\n  - [ ] Validate payload with Zod: `{ currentPassword, newPassword }`\n  - [ ] Verify current password with bcryptjs; hash new password with cost 12\n  - [ ] On success, update `passwordHash` and set `mustChangePassword = false`\n- [ ] Enforce first-login flow (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Update middleware to redirect users with `mustChangePassword` to `/account/password`\n  - [ ] Allow access to `/account/password`, `/sign-in`, and auth APIs while gated\n- [ ] Add change password UI (AC: 1, 2, 4)\n  - [ ] Create `/account/password` page with current + new password fields\n  - [ ] Use warm palette + typography tokens; show clear validation messages\n  - [ ] On success, route to `callbackUrl` (default `/trips`)\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] API tests for change password success/failure and `mustChangePassword` clearing\n  - [ ] Auth tests for `validateCredentials` returning `mustChangePassword`\n  - [ ] Middleware tests for forced redirect to `/account/password`\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Admin-created users currently receive a password via `POST /api/users`; extend this to mark `mustChangePassword` true without changing the creator-config flow. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- Credentials auth is implemented in `validateCredentials` with bcryptjs compare; keep hashing cost consistent (12). [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- The sign-in page already supports `callbackUrl`; reuse that for post-change redirect. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\n- Middleware currently only checks for authentication; extend it to gate `mustChangePassword` while allowing share routes and the change-password page. [Source: travelblogs/src/middleware.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- `PATCH /api/users/[id]/password` must only allow the authenticated user to change their own password.\n- Reject invalid payloads with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` and invalid current passwords with `403 FORBIDDEN`.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n- The legacy creator account defined via `.env` is out of scope for forced change (no `mustChangePassword` field).\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Keep the change password page consistent with the existing sign-in visual language (warm palette, rounded panels, focus rings). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\n- The forced-change state should clearly explain why the user must update their password and block other routes until complete. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and Prisma Migrate for the schema update.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- bcryptjs for password hashing/verification.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- API route: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts`.\n- Auth utils/types: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`, `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- Middleware: `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`.\n- UI: `travelblogs/src/app/account/password/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/users/` and `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/` plus middleware tests.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Successful password change updates hash and clears `mustChangePassword`.\n  - Incorrect current password returns `403` and does not update hash.\n  - Authenticated user cannot change another user's password.\n- Auth tests:\n  - `validateCredentials` returns `mustChangePassword` for DB users.\n- Middleware tests:\n  - Users with `mustChangePassword` are redirected to `/account/password` on protected routes.\n  - `/account/password` remains accessible while gated.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Epic 5 stories standardized role-based auth checks and `{ data, error }` responses; follow the same error contract for new auth routes. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-10-refine-viewer-invitations-with-custom-selector.md]\n- User creation and role updates already use Zod validation and admin gating; reuse that pattern for password change validation. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent work focused on user management and invites; avoid regressions in Auth.js session handling and API error formatting. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- User API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\n- Auth utils: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\n- Sign-in page: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\n- Middleware: `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted change-password flow with forced first-login change and middleware gating.\n- Added API, schema, auth callback, and UI requirements plus test coverage expectations.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts\n- travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts\n- travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/middleware.ts\n"}}
