}`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets,

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Lightweight creator sign-in (single account)\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (MVP + Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR0: Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) for trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nClean, modern sans-serif typography optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Source Sans 3` (crisp, contemporary)\n- Body: `Source Sans 3` (readable and consistent)\n- Fallbacks: `\"Segoe UI\", \"Calibri\", \"Arial\", sans-serif`\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative; CTA and title are focusable.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Keep latest entry preview under 2 lines.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap preview opens latest entry.\n\n### Timeline Entry Card\n\n**Purpose:** Enable fast scanning and navigation through the trip.  \n**Usage:** Timeline list and search results.  \n**Anatomy:** Thumbnail/media strip, title, date, location, short summary.  \n**States:** Default, hover, selected, unread/new.  \n**Variants:** Compact (list), rich (media-heavy).  \n**Accessibility:** Entire card is a link; ensure visible focus state.  \n**Content Guidelines:** Summary capped at 120 chars.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Tap to open entry detail.\n\n### Trip Switcher Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Switch between trips without confusion.  \n**Usage:** Global navigation.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip list with cover thumb, dates, last updated.  \n**States:** Default, selected, empty.  \n**Variants:** Drawer (mobile), popover (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation through list items.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting a trip returns to its latest entry.\n\n### Entry Reader\n\n**Purpose:** Long-form reading with immersive media.  \n**Usage:** Entry detail view.  \n**Anatomy:** Title, meta, media gallery, text body, map snippet.  \n**States:** Default, loading, error.  \n**Variants:** Read-only, contributor-editable.  \n**Accessibility:** Type size 17-18px minimum; skip-to-content.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Scrollable story, sticky top bar for navigation.\n\n### Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Keep spatial context while browsing entries.  \n**Usage:** Trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Map with pins + timeline list.  \n**States:** Default, selected pin, no location data.  \n**Variants:** Side-by-side (desktop), stacked (mobile).  \n**Accessibility:** Keyboard pin navigation; map has list alternative.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Selecting pin highlights timeline entry.\n\n### Share/Invite Panel\n\n**Purpose:** Enable viewer access without friction.  \n**Usage:** Trip settings/share.  \n**Anatomy:** Share link, copy button, invite fields (optional).  \n**States:** Default, copied, error.  \n**Variants:** Minimal (link only), full (invite list).  \n**Accessibility:** Clear labels and focus feedback.  \n**Interaction Behavior:** Copy link shows success state.\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Build custom components on top of design system tokens.\n- Keep core controls consistent with system defaults.\n- Prioritize accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation).\n- Use shared layout primitives for spacing consistency.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (Core Journeys):**\n- Active Trip Hero\n- Timeline Entry Card\n- Entry Reader\n\n**Phase 2 (Navigation + Context):**\n- Trip Switcher Panel\n- Map + Timeline Sync Panel\n\n**Phase 3 (Sharing):**\n- Share/Invite Panel\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n**When to Use:** Primary for the single most important action; secondary for supportive actions; destructive only when necessary.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Primary: Teal filled buttons  \n- Secondary: Ghost style (text + subtle hover)  \n- Destructive: Clay red with clear label  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Only one primary action per view  \n- Destructive actions require confirm modal  \n**Accessibility:** Clear focus states and minimum 44px touch targets  \n**Mobile Considerations:** Primary action anchored near thumb-reach when possible\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Trip creation, entry creation/editing, sharing.  \n**Visual Design:** Labels above fields with asterisk for required fields.  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Inline validation as users type  \n- Errors appear below field with gentle, human language  \n- Submit disabled until required fields are valid  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Associate labels/inputs  \n- Error text announced by screen readers  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Large tap targets and clear spacing between inputs\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n**When to Use:** Global navigation, trip switching, entry browsing.  \n**Visual Design:**  \n- Desktop: Sidebar navigation with hamburger menu  \n- Mobile: Bottom button bar for primary sections  \n**Behavior:**  \n- Latest entry is visible on entry, but no persistent CTA  \n- Trips are always accessible via the nav  \n**Accessibility:**  \n- Keyboard support for sidebar menu  \n- Clear active state indicator  \n**Mobile Considerations:**  \n- Bottom bar stays visible during scrolling\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop:** Map + timeline side-by-side for maximum context.\n- **Tablet:** Stacked layout (map above timeline) to keep reading simple.\n- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with bottom navigation for primary sections.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- **Mobile:** <768px  \n- **Tablet:** 768-1023px  \n- **Desktop:** 1024px+\n\nMobile-first layout with progressive enhancement for larger screens.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- Target **WCAG AA** compliance.\n- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.\n- Visible focus states for all interactive elements.\n- Minimum 44x44px touch targets.\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Basic accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast checks.\n- Responsive device checks across mobile/tablet/desktop in major browsers.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary.\n- Support keyboard navigation for menus and drawers.\n- Keep line lengths and spacing optimized for readability.\n- Avoid hover-only interactions;

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to enable a viewer to contribute to a specific trip,\nso that trusted people can add or edit entries.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I enable contributor access for a viewer  \n   **Then** that viewer gains contributor permissions for this trip only\n2. **Given** I disable contributor access  \n   **When** the viewer tries to add or edit entries  \n   **Then** they are blocked and can only view the trip\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add contributor access update API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` to toggle `canContribute`\n  - [x] Validate `canContribute` boolean with Zod; return `{ data, error }`\n  - [x] Enforce creator + trip owner authorization\n  - [x] Return 404 for missing invite, 400 for invalid payload\n- [x] Allow contributors to add/edit entries (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Update entry create API to allow `canContribute === true`\n  - [x] Update entry update API to allow `canContribute === true`\n  - [x] Keep delete restricted to creator/owner\n- [x] Update invite UI to manage contributor access (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Show contributor status in invited viewer list\n  - [x] Add toggle or action to enable/disable contribution per viewer\n  - [x] Keep styling aligned with share panel patterns\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests for contributor toggle + access gating\n  - [x] API tests for contributor create/edit entries\n  - [x] Component tests for contributor toggle UI and error states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Trip access already exists via `TripAccess` with `canContribute` in Prisma; add a toggle endpoint and surface it in UI. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Current viewer invites/list live under `/api/trips/:id/viewers` with creator-only ownership checks; extend with `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts]\n- Entry create/edit are currently owner-only; allow contributors with `canContribute === true` for the trip while keeping delete creator-only. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\n- Access helper `hasTripAccess` only checks membership; add/adjust helper for `canContribute` to avoid duplicating logic. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Invite UI is in the share panel of trip detail; add per-viewer contributor toggle with existing styling. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Follow response format `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` and App Router-only API routes. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add a contributor toggle API: `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` accepting `{ canContribute: boolean }`.\n- Only the trip owner (creator) can toggle contributor access; use the same auth/ownership checks as invite endpoints.\n- 404 for missing trip or invite, 400 for invalid payload, 401/403 for auth failures.\n- Update entry create and entry update to allow contributors with `canContribute === true` on the trip; keep delete creator-only.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO date strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n- Follow naming conventions: camelCase JSON, plural REST paths, singular table names.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts` (PATCH).\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts` and `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\n- UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Shared access helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` plus `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for contributor toggle success, unauthorized access, and missing invite.\n- API tests that contributors can create and edit entries, but cannot delete.\n- Component tests for contributor toggle UI state, error display, and optimistic updates.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.4 added `TripAccess` with `canContribute` default false plus invite list/remove APIs and share panel UI. Reuse the same access checks and response formatting. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Eligible invitee logic and viewer list live in `trip-detail.tsx`; extend the invited list UI rather than creating a new panel. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent work added user management, viewer invites, and trip access checks; avoid regressions in Auth.js session usage and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; extend with a contributor check to minimize repeated queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only, REST endpoints plural, and API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: review\n- Completion note: Contributor access toggles, contributor entry permissions, and share panel controls implemented and tested.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip access schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n- Trip viewer APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`\n- Trip viewer removal API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts`\n- Eligible viewers API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/eligible/route.ts`\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted contributor toggle API, contributor entry permissions, UI updates, and test coverage expectations.\n- Shipped contributor toggle API with Zod validation plus viewer tests for success/invalid/missing invite cases.\n- Allowed contributors to create/update entries via shared access helper and covered contributor create/edit/delete gating in entry tests.\n- Added contributor status badges and toggle controls to the share panel with optimistic updates and error handling tests.\n- Completed contributor API and UI test coverage for toggle, create/edit gating, and share panel behaviors.\n- Hardened contributor access checks for inactive users and added defensive UI toggle guards.\n- Added trip-only scope copy for contributor access plus tests for inactive contributor blocks.\n\n### File List\n\n- .codex/history.jsonl\n- .codex/log/codex-tui.log\n- .codex/version.json\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/update-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/delete-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-31: Added contributor toggle API, contributor entry permissions, share panel controls, and test coverage.\n- 2025-12-31: Guarded contributor toggles, enforced active-user checks, and expanded inactive contributor tests.\n- 2025-12-31: Synced sprint-status tracking for story review updates.\n"}}

Your mission is to **thoroughly review** a story file that was generated by the create-story workflow and **systematically identify any mistakes, omissions, or disasters** that the original LLM missed.\n\n**Your purpose is NOT just to validate - it's to FIX and PREVENT LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n### **🚨 CRITICAL MISTAKES TO PREVENT:**\n\n- **Reinventing wheels** - Creating duplicate functionality instead of reusing existing\n- **Wrong libraries** - Using incorrect frameworks, versions, or dependencies\n- **Wrong file locations** - Violating project structure and organization\n- **Breaking regressions** - Implementing changes that break existing functionality\n- **Ignoring UX** - Not following user experience design requirements\n- **Vague implementations** - Creating unclear, ambiguous implementations\n- **Lying about completion** - Implementing incorrectly or incompletely\n- **Not learning from past work** - Ignoring previous story learnings and patterns\n\n### **🚨 EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:**\n\nYou must thoroughly analyze **ALL artifacts** to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important quality control function in the entire development process!\n\n### **🔬 UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS:**\n\nUse research subagents, subprocesses, or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts **simultaneously and thoroughly**. Leave no stone unturned!\n\n### **🎯 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE:**\n\nThis is a COMPETITION to create the **ULTIMATE story context** that makes LLM developer mistakes **IMPOSSIBLE**!\n\n## **🚀 HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST**\n\n### **When Running from Create-Story Workflow:**\n\n- The `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml` framework will automatically:\n  - Load this checklist file\n  - Load the newly created story file (`{story_file_path}`)\n  - Load workflow variables from `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml`\n  - Execute the validation process\n\n### **When Running in Fresh Context:**\n\n- User should provide the story file path being reviewed\n- Load the story file directly\n- Load the corresponding workflow.yaml for variable context\n- Proceed with systematic analysis\n\n### **Required Inputs:**\n\n- **Story file**: The story file to review and improve\n- **Workflow variables**: From workflow.yaml (story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, etc.)\n- **Source documents**: Epics, architecture, etc. (discovered or provided)\n- **Validation framework**: `validate-workflow.xml` (handles checklist execution)\n\n---\n\n## **🔬 SYSTEMATIC RE-ANALYSIS APPROACH**\n\nYou will systematically re-do the entire story creation process, but with a critical eye for what the original LLM might have missed:\n\n### **Step 1: Load and Understand the Target**\n\n1. **Load the workflow configuration**: `{installed_path}/workflow.yaml` for variable inclusion\n2. **Load the story file**: `{story_file_path}` (provided by user or discovered)\n3. **Load validation framework**: `{project_root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml`\n4. **Extract metadata**: epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title from story file\n5. **Resolve all workflow variables**: story_dir, output_folder, epics_file, architecture_file, etc.\n6. **Understand current status**: What story implementation guidance is currently provided?\n\n**Note:** If running in fresh context, user should provide the story file path being reviewed. If running from create-story workflow, the validation framework will automatically discover the checklist and story file.\n\n### **Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis**\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Treat this like YOU are creating the story from scratch to PREVENT DISASTERS!**\n**Discover everything the original LLM missed that could cause developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters!**\n\n#### **2.1 Epics and Stories Analysis**\n\n- Load `{epics_file}` (or sharded equivalents)\n- Extract **COMPLETE Epic {{epic_num}} context**:\n  - Epic objectives and business value\n  - ALL stories in this epic (for cross-story context)\n  - Our specific story's requirements, acceptance criteria\n  - Technical requirements and constraints\n  - Cross-story dependencies and prerequisites\n\n#### **2.2 Architecture Deep-Dive**\n\n- Load `{architecture_file}` (single or sharded)\n- **Systematically scan for ANYTHING relevant to this story:**\n  - Technical stack with versions (languages, frameworks, libraries)\n  - Code structure and organization patterns\n  - API design patterns and contracts\n  - Database schemas and relationships\n  - Security requirements and patterns\n  - Performance requirements and optimization strategies\n  - Testing standards and frameworks\n  - Deployment and environment patterns\n  - Integration patterns and external services\n\n#### **2.3 Previous Story Intelligence (if applicable)**\n\n- If `story_num > 1`, load the previous story file\n- Extract **actionable intelligence**:\n  - Dev notes and learnings\n  - Review feedback and corrections needed\n  - Files created/modified and their patterns\n  - Testing approaches that worked/didn't work\n  - Problems encountered and solutions found\n  - Code patterns and conventions established\n\n#### **2.4 Git History Analysis (if available)**\n\n- Analyze recent commits for patterns:\n  - Files created/modified in previous work\n  - Code patterns and conventions used\n  - Library dependencies added/changed\n  - Architecture decisions implemented\n  - Testing approaches used\n\n#### **2.5 Latest Technical Research**\n\n- Identify any libraries/frameworks mentioned\n- Research latest versions and critical information:\n  - Breaking changes or security updates\n  - Performance improvements or deprecations\n  - Best practices for current versions\n\n### **Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis**\n\n**🚨 CRITICAL: Identify every mistake the original LLM missed that could cause DISASTERS!**\n\n#### **3.1 Reinvention Prevention Gaps**\n\n- **Wheel reinvention:** Areas where developer might create duplicate functionality\n- **Code reuse opportunities** not identified that could prevent redundant work\n- **Existing solutions** not mentioned that developer should extend instead of replace\n\n#### **3.2 Technical Specification DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong libraries/frameworks:** Missing version requirements that could cause compatibility issues\n- **API contract violations:** Missing endpoint specifications that could break integrations\n- **Database schema conflicts:** Missing requirements that could corrupt data\n- **Security vulnerabilities:** Missing security requirements that could expose the system\n- **Performance disasters:** Missing requirements that could cause system failures\n\n#### **3.3 File Structure DISASTERS**\n\n- **Wrong file locations:** Missing organization requirements that could break build processes\n- **Coding standard violations:** Missing conventions that could create inconsistent codebase\n- **Integration pattern breaks:** Missing data flow requirements that could cause system failures\n- **Deployment failures:** Missing environment requirements that could prevent deployment\n\n#### **3.4 Regression DISASTERS**\n\n- **Breaking changes:** Missing requirements that could break existing functionality\n- **Test failures:** Missing test requirements that could allow bugs to reach production\n- **UX violations:** Missing user experience requirements that could ruin the product\n- **Learning failures:** Missing previous story context that could repeat same mistakes\n\n#### **3.5 Implementation DISASTERS**\n\n- **Vague implementations:** Missing details that could lead to incorrect or incomplete work\n- **Completion lies:** Missing acceptance criteria that could allow fake implementations\n- **Scope creep:** Missing boundaries that could cause unnecessary work\n- **Quality failures:** Missing quality requirements that could deliver broken features\n\n### **Step 4: LLM-Dev-Agent Optimization Analysis**\n\n**CRITICAL STEP: Optimize story context for LLM developer agent consumption**\n\n**Analyze current story for LLM optimization issues:**\n\n- **Verbosity problems:** Excessive detail that wastes tokens without adding value\n- **Ambiguity issues:** Vague instructions that could lead to multiple interpretations\n- **Context overload:** Too much information not directly relevant to implementation\n- **Missing critical signals:** Key requirements buried in verbose text\n- **Poor structure:** Information not organized for efficient LLM processing\n\n**Apply LLM Optimization Principles:**\n\n- **Clarity over verbosity:** Be precise and direct, eliminate fluff\n- **Actionable instructions:** Every sentence should guide implementation\n- **Scannable structure:** Use clear headings, bullet points, and emphasis\n- **Token efficiency:** Pack maximum information into minimum text\n- **Unambiguous language:** Clear requirements with no room for interpretation\n\n### **Step 5: Improvement Recommendations**\n\n**For each gap identified, provide specific, actionable improvements:**\n\n#### **5.1 Critical Misses (Must Fix)**\n\n- Missing essential technical requirements\n- Missing previous story context that could cause errors\n- Missing anti-pattern prevention that could lead to duplicate code\n- Missing security or performance requirements\n\n#### **5.2 Enhancement Opportunities (Should Add)**\n\n- Additional architectural guidance that would help developer\n- More detailed technical specifications\n- Better code reuse opportunities\n- Enhanced testing guidance\n\n#### **5.3 Optimization Suggestions (Nice to Have)**\n\n- Performance optimization hints\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n- Enhanced debugging or development tips\n\n#### **5.4 LLM Optimization Improvements**\n\n- Token-efficient phrasing of existing content\n- Clearer structure for LLM processing\n- More actionable and direct instructions\n- Reduced verbosity while maintaining completeness\n\n---\n\n## **🎯 COMPETITION SUCCESS METRICS**\n\n**You WIN against the original LLM if you identify:**\n\n### **Category 1: Critical Misses (Blockers)**\n\n- Essential technical requirements the developer needs but aren't provided\n- Previous story learnings that would prevent errors if ignored\n- Anti-pattern prevention that would prevent code duplication\n- Security or performance requirements that must be followed\n\n### **Category 2: Enhancement Opportunities**\n\n- Architecture guidance that would significantly help implementation\n- Technical specifications that would prevent wrong approaches\n- Code reuse opportunities the developer should know about\n- Testing guidance that would improve quality\n\n### **Category 3: Optimization Insights**\n\n- Performance or efficiency improvements\n- Development workflow optimizations\n- Additional context for complex scenarios\n\n---\n\n## **📋 INTERACTIVE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS**\n\nAfter completing your systematic analysis, present your findings to the user interactively:\n\n### **Step 5: Present Improvement Suggestions**\n\n```\n🎯 **STORY CONTEXT QUALITY REVIEW COMPLETE**\n\n**Story:** {{story_key}} - {{story_title}}\n\nI found {{critical_count}} critical issues, {{enhancement_count}} enhancements, and {{optimization_count}} optimizations.\n\n## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)**\n\n{{list each critical issue with clear, actionable description}}\n\n## **⚡ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Should Add)**\n\n{{list each enhancement with clear benefit description}}\n\n## **✨ OPTIMIZATIONS (Nice to Have)**\n\n{{list each optimization with benefit description}}\n\n## **🤖 LLM OPTIMIZATION (Token Efficiency & Clarity)**\n\n{{list each LLM optimization that will improve dev agent performance:\n- Reduce verbosity while maintaining completeness\n- Improve structure for better LLM processing\n- Make instructions more actionable and direct\n- Enhance clarity and reduce ambiguity}}\n```\n\n### **Step 6: Interactive User Selection**\n\nAfter presenting the suggestions, ask the user:\n\n```\n**IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\nWhich improvements would you like me to apply to the story?\n\n**Select from the numbered list above, or choose:**\n- **all** - Apply all suggested improvements\n- **critical** - Apply only critical issues\n- **select** - I'll choose specific numbers\n- **none** - Keep story as-is\n- **details** - Show me more details about any suggestion\n\nYour choice:\n```\n\n### **Step 7: Apply Selected Improvements**\n\nWhen user accepts improvements:\n\n- **Load the story file**\n- **Apply accepted changes** (make them look natural, as if they were always there)\n- **DO NOT reference** the review process, original LLM, or that changes were \"added\" or \"enhanced\"\n- **Ensure clean, coherent final story** that reads as if it was created perfectly the first time\n\n### **Step 8: Confirmation**\n\nAfter applying changes:\n\n```\n✅ **STORY IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED**\n\nUpdated {{count}} sections in the story file.\n\nThe story now includes comprehensive developer guidance to prevent common implementation issues and ensure flawless execution.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the updated story\n2. Run `dev-story` for implementation\n```\n\n---\n\n## **💪 COMPETITIVE EXCELLENCE MINDSET**\n\n**Your goal:** Improve the story file with dev agent needed context that makes flawless implementation inevitable while being optimized for LLM developer agent consumption. Remember the dev agent will ONLY have this file to use.\n\n**Success Criteria:** The LLM developer agent that processes your improved story will have:\n\n- ✅ Clear technical requirements they must follow\n- ✅ Previous work context they can build upon\n- ✅ Anti-pattern prevention to avoid common mistakes\n- ✅ Comprehensive guidance for efficient implementation\n- ✅ **Optimized content structure** for maximum clarity and minimum token waste\n- ✅ **Actionable instructions** with no ambiguity or verbosity\n- ✅ **Efficient information density** - maximum guidance in minimum text\n\n**Every improvement should make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer to:**\n\n- Reinvent existing solutions\n- Use wrong approaches or libraries\n- Create duplicate functionality\n- Miss critical requirements\n- Make implementation errors\n\n**LLM Optimization Should Make it IMPOSSIBLE for the developer agent to:**\n\n- Misinterpret requirements due to ambiguity\n- Waste tokens on verbose, non-actionable content\n- Struggle to find critical information buried in text\n- Get confused by poor structure or organization\n- Miss key implementation signals due to inefficient communication\n\n**Go create the ultimate developer implementation guide! 🚀**\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts]\\n- `TripAccess` is the single source of truth for invited trips and already enforces active users via access checks. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts] [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\\n- Trips UI currently assumes creator ownership and always shows create/manage actions; gate by `session.user.role`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\\n- Access denial for uninvited trips is already enforced by `hasTripAccess` in trip and entry APIs; keep that behavior intact. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts]\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- Update `GET /api/trips` to return the same list fields for viewers:\\n  - `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`\\n- Viewer query should pull trips from `TripAccess` for the requesting user, ordered by `trip.updatedAt DESC`.\\n- Preserve response envelope `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for failures.\\n- Reject unauthorized roles or missing role in the token with `403 FORBIDDEN` (do not assume creator).\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- App Router route handlers only; keep API under `src/app/api`.\\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and avoid schema changes for this story.\\n- Enforce role-based access checks on the server, even if UI hides creator actions.\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub` and `token.role`.\\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- API update: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`.\\n- Trips page UI updates: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`.\\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts` and relevant component tests under `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- API tests:\\n  - Viewer sees only invited trips (no creator-owned trips unless invited).\\n  - Viewer with no invites receives an empty list (200).\\n  - Missing/unknown role returns 403; unauthenticated returns 401.\\n- Component tests:\\n  - Viewer sees invited trips list and no creator actions.\\n  - Viewer empty state copy renders when no invited trips.\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Trip invites and `TripAccess` records were introduced in Story 5.4; reuse those patterns and avoid new access tables. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and extended access helpers; keep access checks centralized to prevent duplication. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\\n\\n### Git Intelligence Summary\\n\\n- Recent commits added user management, viewer invites, and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; use it for access checks, but list queries should pull from `TripAccess` directly for performance. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n\\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n\\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\\n\\n### Story Completion Status\\n\\n- Status: ready-for-dev\\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\\n\\n### Project Structure Notes\\n\\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\\n- Trip list API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\\n- Trips page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\\n\\n## Dev Agent Record\\n\\n### Agent Model Used\\n\\nCodex (GPT-5)\\n\\n### Debug Log References\\n\\n### Completion Notes List\\n\\n- Drafted viewer trip list API expansion and UI gating requirements.\\n- Added test coverage expectations for viewer list and access denial.\\n\\n### File List\\n\\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md\\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_9hz6TNignS0lDw52ecp1dATV"}}

Must Fix: Add UX requirements for viewer trips list and explicitly define role-based UI gating with concrete empty-state copy.\\n2. Should Improve: Add explicit dependencies on Story 5.4 and list key files and patterns to reuse, plus include sample response payload for `GET /api/trips`.\\n3. Consider: Add a small regression checklist for `/api/trips` and trips page to prevent access regressions.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_dB2PN1yy0jgE4wrGb3koYyuz"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to select invitees from a themed selector and manage the invited list,\nso that inviting viewers is faster and mistakes are easy to undo.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own\n   **When** I open the invite selector\n   **Then** I can choose from all active viewers and creators\n   **And** already invited users are not shown in the selector\n2. **Given** I am viewing the invited users list\n   **When** I remove an invited user\n   **Then** the user is removed from the list\n   **And** they can no longer access the trip\n3. **Given** I am inviting a user\n   **When** I interact with the selector\n   **Then** the selector matches the application's custom share panel styling\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add eligible invitees API (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Add a creator-only endpoint to list eligible invitees (active viewers + creators)\n  - [x] Exclude the trip owner and already invited users from the response\n  - [x] Return consistent `{ data, error }` shape with ISO dates\n- [x] Update invite API to accept selector choice (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Accept `userId` from the selector (keep email-based invites only if still needed)\n  - [x] Allow inviting active creators and viewers\n  - [x] Preserve idempotent behavior on repeated invites\n- [x] Add removal API endpoint (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Implement `DELETE /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` for trip owners\n  - [x] Return `404` for missing invites and `403` for unauthorized access\n- [x] Update trip detail share panel UI (AC: 1, 2, 3)\n  - [x] Replace email input with a themed custom select matching existing share panel styles\n  - [x] Show invitee name + email in the selector\n  - [x] Filter out already invited users from selector options\n  - [x] Add remove actions in the invited users list with confirmable affordance\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests for eligible invitee list, invite by userId, and removal\n  - [x] Component tests for selector filtering and invited-user removal\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Developer Context\n\n- Story 5.4 added viewer invites with email input and a list of invited viewers; this story upgrades that flow.\n- Creator-only gating and ownership checks should stay consistent with existing trip invite endpoints.\n- Existing access checks for invited viewers should remain unchanged after invite removal.\n\n### Epic Context (Epic 5)\n\n- Objective: complete Phase 2 account + role management, including viewer access and contributor permissions.\n- Related stories: 5.4 Invite viewers to a trip; 5.5 Enable contributor access; 5.6 Viewer access to invited trips.\n- Business value: faster invite management with fewer errors and easier cleanup.\n\n### Cross-Story Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n- Requires TripAccess model and invite endpoints from Story 5.4.\n- Requires active users from Story 5.1 and role assignments from Story 5.3.\n\n### Reuse Guidance (Avoid Reinvention)\n\n- Reuse share panel layout and typography patterns in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Reuse API error formatting and Auth.js token gating used in `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`.\n- Reuse existing list item styling for invited viewers to keep the UI consistent.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` only; keep trip viewer endpoints together.\n- UI changes should remain in `travelblogs/src/components/trips/`.\n- Tests belong under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic requirements and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- UX and visual language guidance: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Project-wide rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip share UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Invite API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Eligible invitees must include active users with `viewer` or `creator` roles.\n- The trip owner should never be included in the eligible invitee list.\n- The invite selector must exclude already invited users without relying on manual filtering by the user.\n- Invite removal must revoke access immediately for removed users.\n- Responses must keep `{ data, error }` format with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failure.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for server-side validation only.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts` (extend) and a new removal endpoint.\n- Trip UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests under `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for eligible invitee listing, creator+viewer invites, and removal permissions.\n- Component tests for selector filtering and remove action.\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n - Implementation plan: add eligible invitees endpoint listing active creators/viewers, excluding owner + existing invites.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Implementation plan: accept `userId` on invites and allow creator/viewer roles.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Implementation plan: add removal endpoint for trip owner invites.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Implementation plan: refresh share panel with invitee selector and remove affordance.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Tests: `npm test`.\n - Tests: `npm run lint`.\n - Updated invite selector to custom dropdown styling.\n - Tests: `npm test -- --run tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx`.\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n - Added eligible invitees endpoint for active creators/viewers, excluding owners and existing invites.\n - Added API coverage for eligible invitees listing.\n - Added invite support for userId-based selection and creator roles while keeping idempotency.\n - Added invite removal endpoint with authorization and missing-invite handling.\n - Updated share panel to use invitee selector, filter already invited users, and add remove confirmations.\n - Verified API and component test coverage for invite selection and removal flows.\n - Replaced native select with custom invitee dropdown matching share panel styling.\n - Hardened creator checks to use token role and owner id for invite operations.\n - Prevented stale invite selections and added tests for userId invite errors and eligible auth.\n - Noted unrelated working tree changes outside this story scope during review.\n\n### File List\n\n - _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-10-refine-viewer-invitations-with-custom-selector.md\n - _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n - travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/eligible/route.ts\n - travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts\n - travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts\n - travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n - travelblogs/tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts\n - travelblogs/tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2025-02-14: Added eligible invitee listing, selector-driven invites, removal endpoint, and share panel updates with tests.\n- 2025-12-31: Hardened invite access checks, selector validation, and added review test coverage.\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\\n- Credentials auth is implemented in `validateCredentials` with bcryptjs compare; keep hashing cost consistent (12). [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\\n- The sign-in page already supports `callbackUrl`; reuse that for post-change redirect. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\\n- Middleware currently only checks for authentication; extend it to gate `mustChangePassword` while allowing share routes and the change-password page. [Source: travelblogs/src/middleware.ts]\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- `PATCH /api/users/[id]/password` must only allow the authenticated user to change their own password.\\n- Reject invalid payloads with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` and invalid current passwords with `403 FORBIDDEN`.\\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\\n- The legacy creator account defined via `.env` is out of scope for forced change (no `mustChangePassword` field).\\n\\n### UX Requirements\\n\\n- Keep the change password page consistent with the existing sign-in visual language (warm palette, rounded panels, focus rings). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\\n- The forced-change state should clearly explain why the user must update their password and block other routes until complete. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and Prisma Migrate for the schema update.\\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\\n- bcryptjs for password hashing/verification.\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\\n- API route: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts`.\\n- Auth utils/types: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`, `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\\n- Middleware: `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`.\\n- UI: `travelblogs/src/app/account/password/page.tsx`.\\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/users/` and `travelblogs/tests/api/auth/` plus middleware tests.\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- API tests:\\n  - Successful password change updates hash and clears `mustChangePassword`.\\n  - Incorrect current password returns `403` and does not update hash.\\n  - Authenticated user cannot change another user's password.\\n- Auth tests:\\n  - `validateCredentials` returns `mustChangePassword` for DB users.\\n- Middleware tests:\\n  - Users with `mustChangePassword` are redirected to `/account/password` on protected routes.\\n  - `/account/password` remains accessible while gated.\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Epic 5 stories standardized role-based auth checks and `{ data, error }` responses; follow the same error contract for new auth routes. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-10-refine-viewer-invitations-with-custom-selector.md]\\n- User creation and role updates already use Zod validation and admin gating; reuse that pattern for password change validation. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts]\\n\\n### Git Intelligence Summary\\n\\n- Recent work focused on user management and invites; avoid regressions in Auth.js session handling and API error formatting. [Source: git log -5]\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n\\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n\\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\\n\\n### Story Completion Status\\n\\n- Status: ready-for-dev\\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\\n\\n### Project Structure Notes\\n\\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\\n- User API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`\\n- Auth utils: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\\n- Sign-in page: `travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`\\n- Middleware: `travelblogs/src/middleware.ts`\\n\\n## Dev Agent Record\\n\\n### Agent Model Used\\n\\nCodex (GPT-5)\\n\\n### Debug Log References\\n\\n### Completion Notes List\\n\\n- Drafted change-password flow with forced first-login change and middleware gating.\\n- Added API, schema, auth callback, and UI requirements plus test coverage expectations.\\n\\n### File List\\n\\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\\n- travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma\\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/middleware.ts\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_mNp6yHMCPc7lWOt3DtjEoz6p"}}

(Phase 2)\nFR2: Admin can assign a user role as creator or viewer. (Phase 2)\nFR3: System can authenticate users with email and password. (Phase 2)\nFR4: Creators can sign in and access their trips and entries. (Phase 2)\nFR5: Viewers can sign in and access trips they are allowed to view. (Phase 2)\nFR6: Creators can create trips. (Phase 1)\nFR7: Creators can edit trip metadata (name, dates, cover). (Phase 1)\nFR8: Creators can delete trips. (Phase 2)\nFR9: System can display a list of trips for a creator. (Phase 1)\nFR10: Creators can add a blog entry to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR11: Creators can edit a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR12: Creators can delete a blog entry. (Phase 1)\nFR13: Each entry can include a text body. (Phase 1)\nFR14: Each entry can include multiple media files. (Phase 1)\nFR15: System can display entries in a trip in chronological order. (Phase 1)\nFR16: Users can upload multiple media files in one entry. (Phase 1)\nFR17: System can display media-first entry pages. (Phase 1)\nFR18: System can show media in a gallery or carousel within an entry. (Phase 1)\nFR19: Creators can generate a shareable link to a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR20: Anyone with the shareable link can view the trip. (Phase 1)\nFR21: Creators can invite specific users to a trip as viewers. (Phase 2)\nFR22: Creators can enable a viewer to contribute to a trip. (Phase 2)\nFR23: Viewers can view trips they are invited to. (Phase 2)\nFR24: Viewers with contribution enabled can add entries to that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR25: Viewers with contribution enabled can edit entries in that trip. (Phase 2)\nFR26: System can display a trip map view with entry locations. (Phase 3)\nFR27: System can display a timeline view tied to map locations. (Phase 3)\nFR28: System can extract coordinates from photo metadata. (Phase 3)\nFR29: Users can view a trip overview with latest entries. (Phase 1)\nFR30: Users can open an entry in a single-page view. (Phase 1)\nFR31: Users can navigate between entries in a trip. (Phase 1)\nFR32: Admin can manage user access and roles. (Phase 2)\nFR33: Admin can deactivate users. (Phase 2)\n\n### MVP Scope Adjustment\n\n- Lightweight authentication is required in MVP to protect creator trip/entry management.\n- This is a scope change from the PRD (which labels auth in Phase 2). Update the PRD when convenient.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Page load time is 5-10 seconds under typical home broadband.\nNFR2: Entry switching response time is under 1 second.\nNFR3: Trip switching response time is 2-5 seconds.\nNFR4: Media upload supports 10-15 files per entry under normal consumer bandwidth.\nNFR5: Use HTTPS for all traffic.\nNFR6: Store passwords using secure hashing when user management is introduced (Phase 2).\nNFR7: Shareable links are unguessable.\nNFR8: Support current versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.\nNFR9: Provide responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers.\nNFR10: Accessibility follows standard good practices (UX specifies WCAG AA).\nNFR11: SPA architecture with no multi-page app requirement.\nNFR12: No SEO requirement; app is private.\nNFR13: No real-time updates; viewers refresh to see new entries.\nNFR14: Optimize media loading and rendering to support fast entry switching.\nNFR15: Enforce role-based access on client and server.\nNFR16: Support small groups up to 15 viewers per trip.\nNFR17: Support low concurrency (2-3 concurrent viewers).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Starter: initialize with `npx create-next-app@latest travelblogs` and select TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript; Tailwind CSS for styling.\n- Database: SQLite with Prisma 7.2.0 and Prisma Migrate.\n- Auth: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions.\n- API: REST route handlers under `src/app/api`; endpoints are plural; error format `{ error: { code, message } }`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`; central `tests/` folder.\n- UX system: themeable component library baseline (MUI or Tailwind UI) with custom trip hero, timeline entry card, entry reader, map+timeline panel, share/invite panel.\n- UX layout: media-first entry pages; single-page entry reading; latest entry visible on entry; timeline is primary navigation.\n- UX layout: map + timeline context (desktop side-by-side, tablet/mobile stacked).\n- UX navigation: desktop sidebar + hamburger menu; mobile bottom bar for primary sections.\n- UX accessibility: WCAG AA, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, 44x44 touch targets, 4.5:1 text contrast.\n- UX typography: Fraunces headings, Source Serif 4 body, body size 17-18px, line length 55-75 chars.\n- UX color tokens: warm terracotta primary, deep teal secondary, ivory/sand

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nClean, modern sans-serif typography optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Source Sans 3` (crisp, contemporary)\n- Body: `Source Sans 3` (readable and consistent)\n- Fallbacks: `\"Segoe UI\", \"Calibri\", \"Arial\", sans-serif`\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing;

It lets a trip owner capture entries that blend text and media, invite friends to view or contribute, and preserve a coherent narrative instead of scattered photo dumps. The focus is on structured trip memory, lightweight collaboration, and easy sharing without the noise of social platforms.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nTravelBlogs is trip-first, not album-first. The unified map + timeline creates context around each moment, while clear collaboration roles (owner, viewer, contributor) keep sharing intentional and private. A web-first workflow makes organizing and storytelling easier, with simple mobile capture to avoid phone-only lock-in.\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app  \n**Domain:** general  \n**Complexity:** low  \n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project\n\nClassification signals: “web app”, “web-first”, “browser” from the product brief and our discussion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n- Viewers can follow a trip virtually with high-quality media-first entries and clear location context.\n- A typical viewer can consume a new entry in a few minutes without needing to navigate across multiple pages.\n- Each trip has one entry per day; typical trips run 7–35 days.\n- Each entry includes ~1 page of text and 10–15 media files, presented in a way that feels modern and easy to scan.\n\n### Business Success\n\n- 3-month targets: TBD (active trips, active creators, invited viewers).\n- 12-month targets: TBD (retention, repeat trips, growth).\n- Primary business KPI: TBD (growth vs engagement vs revenue).\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Page load time: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n- Media upload supports multiple files per entry; single-file upload also supported.\n- No offline mode required.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Average entries per trip: 7–35 (aligned to trip length in days).\n- Media per entry: 10–15.\n- Viewer session: can consume a new entry in a few minutes on a single page.\n- Entry navigation meets response-time targets (entry <1s, trip 2–5s).\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Media-first entry pages with high-quality presentation.\n- Map/timeline context that shows where the author is on the trip.\n- One-page entry view optimized for quick consumption.\n- Multi-file media upload per entry.\n- Performance targets for load and navigation.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Enhanced storytelling layouts for richer media experiences.\n- Improved trip overview and discovery of prior entries.\n- Optional sharing refinements (roles, access controls).\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Highly immersive “be there” experience for viewers.\n- Rich, modern storytelling and presentation that feels like a curated travel journal.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n**Journey 1: Tommy (Creator/Owner) — Turning a Trip Into a Story**\nTommy signs in with his email and password. As a creator, he can create and delete trips and edit all content. He starts a new trip (becoming the owner), then invites friends as viewers. For trusted friends, he optionally enables “contribute,” letting them add or edit entries in this trip only. Each day he adds one entry with a page of text and 10–15 photos, confident viewers can consume it on a single page. The map/timeline view keeps the location context clear.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: creator role permissions; trip creation/deletion; ownership; viewer invites; optional contribute permissions per trip; entry creation/editing; map/timeline context.\n\n**Journey 2: Lina (Viewer with Contribute Enabled) — Helping Tell the Story**\nLina is a viewer in the system, but the trip owner enables contribute on this specific trip. She can add her own entries and edit existing ones for that trip, while she still can’t create or delete trips. Updates appear quickly so everyone sees the story evolve.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer role with per‑trip contribute permissions; entry create/edit permissions within a trip; fast update propagation.\n\n**Journey 3: Markus (Viewer) — Following the Trip in Minutes**\nMarkus is invited as a viewer and can only view the trip. He sees a media‑first entry page with clear location context and finishes in a few minutes. He doesn’t need to navigate across multiple pages to understand today’s update, and can quickly open the newest entry.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: viewer‑only access; media‑first entry display; one‑page entry layout; quick access to latest entry; location context.\n\n**Journey 4: Admin (Setup + User Management) — Establishing the System**\nOn first launch, the system creates an admin account. The admin signs in, creates additional users, and assigns them as creator or viewer. This makes it easy to onboard a small group and keep permissions simple.\n\nThis journey reveals requirements for: initial admin creation; user management; system roles (creator/viewer); credential management.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Authentication with email‑as‑username and password.\n- System roles: creator, viewer.\n- Admin can create users and assign roles.\n- Creators can create/delete trips and edit all content.\n- Trip owners can invite viewers and optionally enable per‑trip contribution.\n- Viewers default to read‑only unless contribute is enabled by the trip owner.\n- Media‑first entry creation and single‑page entry viewing.\n- Map/timeline context for “where they are now.”\n- Fast entry switching and trip switching per performance targets.\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTravelBlogs is a single‑page web application focused on private trip journaling and sharing. It prioritizes media‑first storytelling, simple navigation, and role‑based access.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- SPA architecture; no MPA requirements.\n- Private use; SEO is not required.\n- No real‑time updates; viewers can refresh to see new entries.\n- Support current versions of all common browsers.\n\n### Browser Matrix\n\n- Chrome (current), Safari (current), Firefox (current), Edge (current).\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers, prioritizing media display and readability.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n- Page load: 5–10 seconds.\n- Entry switching: <1 second.\n- Trip switching: 2–5 seconds.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\n- No special accessibility requirements beyond standard good practices.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Optimize media loading and rendering for fast entry switching.\n- Ensure role‑based access is enforced on the client and server.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Platform MVP — build the foundation for future expansion while keeping the initial scope lean.  \n**Resource Requirements:** Small team focused on core trip + entry flows, media handling, and basic sharing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Creator/Owner (single user or small trusted group)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Lightweight creator sign-in (single account)\n- Create trips\n- Add daily blog entries per trip\n- Entry content: ~1 page of text + 10–15 media files\n- Media-first entry display optimized for quick consumption\n- Basic sharing for trusted friends (no full user management)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- User management (admin, creator/viewer roles)\n- Trip-level permissions (viewer vs contributor)\n- Role-based access controls\n- Improved sharing controls\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Map features and timeline visualization\n- Coordinate extraction from photos\n- Richer storytelling layouts and discovery\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Media handling and performance at scale → validate with realistic media sizes early.  \n**Market Risks:** Viewer value unclear → focus MVP on “quick, media-first consumption.”  \n**Resource Risks:** If time is limited, defer collaboration roles and maps until after core entry flow is stable.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Accounts & Roles (MVP + Post‑MVP)\n\n- FR0: Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) for trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to see trips I've been invited to,\nso that I can view the shared travel story.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as a viewer with trip invites\n   **When** I open my trips list\n   **Then** I see the trips I've been invited to\n2. **Given** I try to access a trip I have not been invited to\n   **When** I open its link or route\n   **Then** I am denied access\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Expand trip listing API to support viewer invites (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Update `GET /api/trips` to allow viewer access and return invited trips\n  - [x] Keep creator behavior unchanged (creator sees owned trips only)\n  - [x] Return `403` when role is missing/unknown and `401` when unauthenticated\n- [x] Update trips page to reflect viewer access (AC: 1)\n  - [x] Use session role to show viewer-friendly header and empty state\n  - [x] Hide creator-only actions (create trip, manage users) for viewers\n- [x] Ensure read-only access gates remain enforced (AC: 2)\n  - [x] Verify trip detail and entry list endpoints deny access without `TripAccess`\n  - [x] Keep create/edit/delete actions creator-only or contributor-only\n- [x] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Extend API list tests for viewer invites and empty list\n  - [x] Add/adjust component tests for viewer trips page states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- `GET /api/trips` currently rejects non-creator requests; update it to branch on `token.role` and query `TripAccess` for viewer lists. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts]\n- `TripAccess` is the single source of truth for invited trips and already enforces active users via access checks. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts] [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Trips UI currently assumes creator ownership and always shows create/manage actions; gate by `session.user.role`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n- Access denial for uninvited trips is already enforced by `hasTripAccess` in trip and entry APIs; keep that behavior intact. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Update `GET /api/trips` to return the same list fields for viewers:\n  - `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`\n- Viewer query should pull trips from `TripAccess` for the requesting user, ordered by `trip.updatedAt DESC`.\n- Preserve response envelope `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n- Reject unauthorized roles or missing role in the token with `403 FORBIDDEN` (do not assume creator).\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Keep the trips list layout aligned with the existing warm palette and typography system; do not introduce new layout patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- For viewers, use a read-only trips list with a clear header and empty state copy (no create/manage actions). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router route handlers only; keep API under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and avoid schema changes for this story.\n- Enforce role-based access checks on the server, even if UI hides creator actions.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub` and `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API update: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`.\n- Trips page UI updates: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts` and relevant component tests under `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Viewer sees only invited trips (no creator-owned trips unless invited).\n  - Viewer with no invites receives an empty list (200).\n  - Missing/unknown role returns 403; unauthenticated returns 401.\n- Component tests:\n  - Viewer sees invited trips list and no creator actions.\n  - Viewer empty state copy renders when no invited trips.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Trip invites and `TripAccess` records were introduced in Story 5.4; reuse those patterns and avoid new access tables. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and extended access helpers; keep access checks centralized to prevent duplication. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added user management, viewer invites, and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; use it for access checks, but list queries should pull from `TripAccess` directly for performance. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip list API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- Trips page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Gate trip list API by `token.role` and return viewer lists via `TripAccess`.\n- Update trips page header/actions/empty states by session role.\n- Add API + component tests for viewer list and empty state coverage.\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Implemented viewer-aware list handling in `GET /api/trips`, preserving creator ownership behavior and role-based errors.\n- Updated trips page copy/actions for viewer read-only list/empty states.\n- Added API and component tests; ran `npm test`.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trips-page.test.tsx\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2026-01-03: Enabled viewer trip list access + viewer trips UI gating; added tests.\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\\n- Entry pages currently check `trip.ownerId === session.user.id` and will block contributors; update to use `TripAccess` plus `canContributeToTrip` where needed. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx]\\n- Entry detail actions always show edit/delete; ensure delete remains creator-only and edit is shown for contributors. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx]\\n- Trip access helpers are centralized; avoid duplicating access queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- Contributors can create and edit entries only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\\n- View-only users may view entries but cannot access create/edit routes.\\n- `DELETE /api/entries/:id` remains creator-only.\\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\\n- Use centralized access helpers in `src/utils/` (no new `lib/`).\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/new/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`.\\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`.\\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- API tests:\\n  - Contributors can create and edit entries for invited trips.\\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on create/edit.\\n  - Creators remain allowed for all entry actions; delete stays creator-only.\\n- Component/page tests:\\n  - Contributor sees edit action but not delete.\\n  - View-only users do not see edit/delete actions.\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and already updated entry APIs; focus on UI and page gating to match API rules. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\\n- Story 5.6 updated viewer trip access; keep view-only users read-only in entry flows. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\\n\\n### Git Intelligence Summary\\n\\n- Recent commits added contributor access and viewer invites; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n\\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n\\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\\n\\n### Story Completion Status\\n\\n- Status: ready-for-dev\\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\\n\\n### Project Structure Notes\\n\\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`\\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`\\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\\n\\n## Dev Agent Record\\n\\n### Agent Model Used\\n\\nCodex (GPT-5)\\n\\n### Debug Log References\\n\\n### Completion Notes List\\n\\n- Drafted contributor entry flow guidance focusing on UI gating and action visibility.\\n- Reused existing contributor API checks and access helper patterns.\\n\\n### File List\\n\\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md\\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md\\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_L7WT4Inmmeg2Hd5zeyyy4UoL"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\\n\\n## Story\\n\\nAs a user (creator, contributor, or viewer),\\nI want to open the shared viewer experience for a trip,\\nso that I can read the trip story in the best viewing mode.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. **Given** I am signed in and have access to a trip\\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\\n   **Then** I see a \\\"View\\\" button that opens the shared-view reader for that trip\\n2. **Given** I am a contributor or the trip owner\\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\\n   **Then** I also see an \\\"Edit\\\" button for the trip\\n3. **Given** I am a viewer without contributor access\\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\\n   **Then** I do not see the \\\"Edit\\\" button\\n4. **Given** the shared-view link does not yet exist\\n   **When** I select \\\"View\\\"\\n   **Then** the system creates (or retrieves) the share link and opens the shared-view reader\\n\\n## Tasks / Subtasks\\n\\n- [ ] Add shared-view entry point on trip detail (AC: 1, 4)\\n  - [ ] Reuse existing share-link API to fetch/create the shared view URL\\n  - [ ] Add a \\\"View\\\" button next to trip actions and open `/trips/share/[token]`\\n- [ ] Gate edit affordance by role/access (AC: 2, 3)\\n  - [ ] Show \\\"Edit\\\" only when `canEditTrip === true`\\n  - [ ] Keep viewers read-only (no edit affordance)\\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\\n  - [ ] Component test for \\\"View\\\" button visibility and click behavior\\n  - [ ] Component test for \\\"Edit\\\" button visibility based on role\\n\\n## Dev Notes\\n\\n- The shared-view experience already exists at `/trips/share/[token]`; use the share-link API to get or create the token. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx]\\n- Trip detail already manages share-link state; integrate the \\\"View\\\" button with that state instead of adding new endpoints. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\\n- Trip access flags are passed from the trip detail page (`canEditTrip`, etc.); use those for gating buttons. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx]\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- The \\\"View\\\" button must open the shared-view URL (`/trips/share/[token]`) for the current trip.\\n- If the share link is missing, the button should create or fetch one via existing share-link API and then open it.\\n- The \\\"Edit\\\" button must link to the current trip edit experience (`/trips/[tripId]/edit`).\\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\\n\\n### UX Requirements\\n\\n- Buttons should match the existing trip action styling and hierarchy (warm palette, rounded buttons). [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\\n- View should be the primary action for viewers; edit should remain secondary and hidden for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`.\\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- Component tests:\\n  - View button visible for all authorized roles with trip access.\\n  - Edit button visible only for contributors/owners.\\n  - Clicking view opens `/trips/share/[token]` (using mocked share-link API).\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Story 4.1/4.5 established share-link behavior and invalidation; reuse those endpoints and patterns.

[Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts]\\n- Trip permissions (viewer vs contributor) are modeled via `TripAccess.canContribute`; use existing access helper or props to determine contributor content. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\\n- Follow existing page layout style for centered panels and warm palette. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n\\n- The manual page must be accessible to authenticated users and reflect their role and trip permissions.\\n- The manual must clearly document navigation and actions for each role without exposing actions the user cannot perform.\\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` where API data is used.\\n\\n### UX Requirements\\n\\n- Use the established typography system and warm palette; keep line lengths readable (55-75 chars). [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\\n- Manual content should be scannable with headings, short paragraphs, and action lists.\\n\\n### Architecture Compliance\\n\\n- App Router only; page under `src/app`.\\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation only if needed (server-side only).\\n\\n### Library/Framework Requirements\\n\\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\\n\\n### File Structure Requirements\\n\\n- Manual UI: `travelblogs/src/app/manual/page.tsx`.\\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\\n\\n### Testing Requirements\\n\\n- Component tests:\\n  - Viewer role sees viewer-only actions.\\n  - Contributor sees contributor actions.\\n  - Creator sees admin/trip management actions.\\n\\n### Previous Story Intelligence\\n\\n- Epic 5 stories established role-based access and contributor permissions; reuse those rules for manual content. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\\n- Viewer access rules are defined in Story 5.6; do not advertise contributor actions to view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\\n\\n### Git Intelligence Summary\\n\\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\\n\\n### Latest Tech Information\\n\\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\\n\\n### Project Context Reference\\n\\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\\n\\n### Story Completion Status\\n\\n- Status: ready-for-dev\\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\\n\\n### Project Structure Notes\\n\\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\\n- Auth options: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\\n\\n## Dev Agent Record\\n\\n### Agent Model Used\\n\\nCodex (GPT-5)\\n\\n### Debug Log References\\n\\n### Completion Notes List\\n\\n- Drafted role-based manual content requirements and UI page scope.\\n- Added test coverage expectations for role-specific manual content.\\n\\n### File List\\n\\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts\\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs\"}","call_id":"call_ob3dtMeTDD3krCCiCsZrdloo"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user (creator, contributor, or viewer),\nI want to open the shared viewer experience for a trip,\nso that I can read the trip story in the best viewing mode.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in and have access to a trip\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I see a \"View\" button that opens the shared-view reader for that trip\n2. **Given** I am a contributor or the trip owner\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I also see an \"Edit\" button for the trip\n3. **Given** I am a viewer without contributor access\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I do not see the \"Edit\" button\n4. **Given** the shared-view link does not yet exist\n   **When** I select \"View\"\n   **Then** the system creates (or retrieves) the share link and opens the shared-view reader\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add shared-view entry point on trip detail (AC: 1, 4)\n  - [x] Reuse existing share-link API to fetch/create the shared view URL\n  - [x] Add a \"View\" button next to trip actions and open `/trips/share/[token]`\n- [x] Gate edit affordance by role/access (AC: 2, 3)\n  - [x] Show \"Edit\" only when `canEditTrip === true`\n  - [x] Keep viewers read-only (no edit affordance)\n- [x] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [x] Component test for \"View\" button visibility and click behavior\n  - [x] Component test for \"Edit\" button visibility based on role\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- The shared-view experience already exists at `/trips/share/[token]`; use the share-link API to get or create the token. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx]\n- Trip detail already manages share-link state; integrate the \"View\" button with that state instead of adding new endpoints. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access flags are passed from the trip detail page (`canEditTrip`, etc.); use those for gating buttons. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- The \"View\" button must open the shared-view URL (`/trips/share/[token]`) for the current trip.\n- If the share link is missing, the button should create or fetch one via existing share-link API and then open it.\n- The \"Edit\" button must link to the current trip edit experience (`/trips/[tripId]/edit`).\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Buttons should match the existing trip action styling and hierarchy (warm palette, rounded buttons). [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- View should be the primary action for viewers; edit should remain secondary and hidden for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`.\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - View button visible for all authorized roles with trip access.\n  - Edit button visible only for contributors/owners.\n  - Clicking view opens `/trips/share/[token]` (using mocked share-link API).\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.1/4.5 established share-link behavior and invalidation; reuse those endpoints and patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-5-invalidate-shared-entry-pages-on-revoke.md]\n- Story 5.6 added viewer access gating; maintain read-only affordances for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and trip access gating; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: review\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`\n- Share link API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted shared-view button requirements with role-gated edit affordance.\n- Reused existing share-link API and shared-view route patterns.\n- Implemented shared-view action on trip detail with share-link creation and router navigation.\n- Allowed share-link GET/POST for users with trip access while keeping owner-only rotate/revoke.\n- Added component/API coverage for view access and share-link access; ran `npm test` and `npm run lint`.\n\n"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"\nYou must fully embody this agent's persona and follow all activation instructions exactly as specified.

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
