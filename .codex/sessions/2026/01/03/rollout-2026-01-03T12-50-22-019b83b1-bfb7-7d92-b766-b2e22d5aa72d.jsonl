Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to see trips I've been invited to,\nso that I can view the shared travel story.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as a viewer with trip invites\n   **When** I open my trips list\n   **Then** I see the trips I've been invited to\n2. **Given** I try to access a trip I have not been invited to\n   **When** I open its link or route\n   **Then** I am denied access\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Expand trip listing API to support viewer invites (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Update `GET /api/trips` to allow viewer access and return invited trips\n  - [ ] Keep creator behavior unchanged (creator sees owned trips only)\n  - [ ] Return `403` when role is missing/unknown and `401` when unauthenticated\n- [ ] Update trips page to reflect viewer access (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Use session role to show viewer-friendly header and empty state\n  - [ ] Hide creator-only actions (create trip, manage users) for viewers\n- [ ] Ensure read-only access gates remain enforced (AC: 2)\n  - [ ] Verify trip detail and entry list endpoints deny access without `TripAccess`\n  - [ ] Keep create/edit/delete actions creator-only or contributor-only\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Extend API list tests for viewer invites and empty list\n  - [ ] Add/adjust component tests for viewer trips page states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- `GET /api/trips` currently rejects non-creator requests; update it to branch on `token.role` and query `TripAccess` for viewer lists. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts]\n- `TripAccess` is the single source of truth for invited trips and already enforces active users via access checks. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts] [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Trips UI currently assumes creator ownership and always shows create/manage actions; gate by `session.user.role`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n- Access denial for uninvited trips is already enforced by `hasTripAccess` in trip and entry APIs; keep that behavior intact. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Update `GET /api/trips` to return the same list fields for viewers:\n  - `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`\n- Viewer query should pull trips from `TripAccess` for the requesting user, ordered by `trip.updatedAt DESC`.\n- Preserve response envelope `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n- Reject unauthorized roles or missing role in the token with `403 FORBIDDEN` (do not assume creator).\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Keep the trips list layout aligned with the existing warm palette and typography system; do not introduce new layout patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- For viewers, use a read-only trips list with a clear header and empty state copy (no create/manage actions). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router route handlers only; keep API under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and avoid schema changes for this story.\n- Enforce role-based access checks on the server, even if UI hides creator actions.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub` and `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API update: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`.\n- Trips page UI updates: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts` and relevant component tests under `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Viewer sees only invited trips (no creator-owned trips unless invited).\n  - Viewer with no invites receives an empty list (200).\n  - Missing/unknown role returns 403; unauthenticated returns 401.\n- Component tests:\n  - Viewer sees invited trips list and no creator actions.\n  - Viewer empty state copy renders when no invited trips.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Trip invites and `TripAccess` records were introduced in Story 5.4; reuse those patterns and avoid new access tables. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and extended access helpers; keep access checks centralized to prevent duplication. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added user management, viewer invites, and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; use it for access checks, but list queries should pull from `TripAccess` directly for performance. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip list API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- Trips page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted viewer trip list API expansion and UI gating requirements.\n- Added test coverage expectations for viewer list and access denial.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a viewer,\nI want to see trips I've been invited to,\nso that I can view the shared travel story.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as a viewer with trip invites\n   **When** I open my trips list\n   **Then** I see the trips I've been invited to\n2. **Given** I try to access a trip I have not been invited to\n   **When** I open its link or route\n   **Then** I am denied access\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Expand trip listing API to support viewer invites (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Update `GET /api/trips` to allow viewer access and return invited trips\n  - [ ] Keep creator behavior unchanged (creator sees owned trips only)\n  - [ ] Return `403` when role is missing/unknown and `401` when unauthenticated\n- [ ] Update trips page to reflect viewer access (AC: 1)\n  - [ ] Use session role to show viewer-friendly header and empty state\n  - [ ] Hide creator-only actions (create trip, manage users) for viewers\n- [ ] Ensure read-only access gates remain enforced (AC: 2)\n  - [ ] Verify trip detail and entry list endpoints deny access without `TripAccess`\n  - [ ] Keep create/edit/delete actions creator-only or contributor-only\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Extend API list tests for viewer invites and empty list\n  - [ ] Add/adjust component tests for viewer trips page states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- `GET /api/trips` currently rejects non-creator requests; update it to branch on `token.role` and query `TripAccess` for viewer lists. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts]\n- `TripAccess` is the single source of truth for invited trips and already enforces active users via access checks. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts] [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Trips UI currently assumes creator ownership and always shows create/manage actions; gate by `session.user.role`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n- Access denial for uninvited trips is already enforced by `hasTripAccess` in trip and entry APIs; keep that behavior intact. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Update `GET /api/trips` to return the same list fields for viewers:\n  - `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`\n- Viewer query should pull trips from `TripAccess` for the requesting user, ordered by `trip.updatedAt DESC`.\n- Preserve response envelope `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n- Reject unauthorized roles or missing role in the token with `403 FORBIDDEN` (do not assume creator).\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Keep the trips list layout aligned with the existing warm palette and typography system; do not introduce new layout patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- For viewers, use a read-only trips list with a clear header and empty state copy (no create/manage actions). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router route handlers only; keep API under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and avoid schema changes for this story.\n- Enforce role-based access checks on the server, even if UI hides creator actions.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub` and `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API update: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`.\n- Trips page UI updates: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts` and relevant component tests under `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Viewer sees only invited trips (no creator-owned trips unless invited).\n  - Viewer with no invites receives an empty list (200).\n  - Missing/unknown role returns 403; unauthenticated returns 401.\n- Component tests:\n  - Viewer sees invited trips list and no creator actions.\n  - Viewer empty state copy renders when no invited trips.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Trip invites and `TripAccess` records were introduced in Story 5.4; reuse those patterns and avoid new access tables. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and extended access helpers; keep access checks centralized to prevent duplication. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added user management, viewer invites, and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; use it for access checks, but list queries should pull from `TripAccess` directly for performance. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip list API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- Trips page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted viewer trip list API expansion and UI gating requirements.\n- Added test coverage expectations for viewer list and access denial.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts\n"}}
