[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\n- Entry pages currently check `trip.ownerId === session.user.id` and will block contributors; update to use `TripAccess` plus `canContributeToTrip` where needed. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx]\n- Entry detail actions always show edit/delete; ensure delete remains creator-only and edit is shown for contributors. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access helpers are centralized; avoid duplicating access queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Trip metadata edits currently check owner-only; update to allow contributors with `canContributeToTrip` while keeping delete owner-only. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Contributors can create and edit entries only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\n- View-only users may view entries but cannot access create/edit routes.\n- `DELETE /api/entries/:id` remains creator-only.\n- Contributors can edit trip metadata only for trips where `TripAccess.canContribute === true`.\n- `DELETE /api/trips/:id` remains creator-only.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Use centralized access helpers in `src/utils/` (no new `lib/`).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Trip API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts`.\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/new/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`.\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n- Trip tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Contributors can create and edit entries for invited trips.\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on create/edit.\n  - Creators remain allowed for all entry actions; delete stays creator-only.\n  - Contributors can edit trip metadata for invited trips.\n  - View-only users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on trip edit.\n- Component/page tests:\n  - Contributor sees edit action but not delete.\n  - View-only users do not see edit/delete actions.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and already updated entry APIs; focus on UI and page gating to match API rules. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n- Story 5.6 updated viewer trip access; keep view-only users read-only in entry flows. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added contributor access and viewer invites; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: review\n- Completion note: Contributor entry and trip metadata permissions validated with new tests; full test suite passing.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\n- Entry pages: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx`\n- Entry UI: `travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Change Log\n\n- Addressed contributor create/edit access verification and expanded tests for view-only users and delete permissions. (Date: 2025-12-29)\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted contributor entry flow guidance focusing on UI gating and action visibility.\n- Reused existing contributor API checks and access helper patterns.\n- Verified entry API permissions for contributors and creator-only deletes; full test suite passed (`npm test`).\n- Confirmed trip metadata contributor permissions and creator-only delete; full test suite passed (`npm test`).\n- Confirmed entry detail/edit gating and action visibility already allow contributors while keeping deletes owner-only; full test suite passed (`npm test`).\n- Verified create/edit gating for non-contributors and added tests for view-only entry edit denial and action visibility; full test suite passed (`npm test`).\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-7-contributor-adds-and-edits-entries.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/update-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/components/entry-detail.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/entries/[entryId]/edit/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n"}}

}`; responses wrapped in `{ data, error }`.\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1; server-side only.\n- Authorization: role checks plus per-trip ACL.\n- State: Redux Toolkit 2.11.2; async status pattern `idle | loading | succeeded | failed`.\n- Data fetching: server components plus `fetch`.\n- Media: Next.js Image with lazy loading; media stored on NAS filesystem.\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS; `.env` configuration; basic file logging; no rate limiting or TLS proxy in MVP.\n- Naming/structure: singular table names; camelCase columns; feature-based components under `src/components/<feature>`;

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe MVP focuses on trip and entry creation, media-first entry display, and shareable viewing via unguessable links. Post-MVP adds user management with roles (admin/creator/viewer), trip-level contributor permissions, and richer sharing controls. Expansion includes map + timeline visualization and optional location extraction from media.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nPerformance targets (page load 5-10s, entry switch <1s, trip switch 2-5s) and media upload support (10-15 files per entry). Security via HTTPS and secure password hashing (Phase 2). Shareable links must be unguessable. Responsiveness across mobile/desktop, current browsers, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nLow complexity, small-group usage (up to ~15 viewers per trip, low concurrency), but media storage/delivery and privacy constraints require careful design.\n\n- Primary domain: web app (SPA)\n- Complexity level: low\n- Estimated architectural components: 5-7 (web client, API, auth, media storage/CDN, database, sharing/permissions, optional map services)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Web-first SPA; no SEO, no realtime, no offline.\n- Must support modern browsers across desktop and mobile.\n- UX emphasizes media-first layouts and fast navigation.\n- Future map/timeline features imply optional mapping/geocoding dependencies.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Access control and sharing permissions (public link vs authenticated roles).\n- Media storage, upload throughput, and performant delivery.\n- Client performance for media-heavy pages and quick entry switching.\n- Responsive design and WCAG AA accessibility compliance.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (Next.js + TypeScript) based on project requirements and preferences.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n1) **create-next-app (official Next.js CLI)**\n- Lean baseline; lets us opt into TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, ESLint, and `src/` layout.\n- Keeps architecture simple for a low-complexity MVP and self-hosting on a NAS.\n- Database and auth can be added explicitly (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres; Auth.js or custom).\n\n2) **Create T3 App (create t3-app)**\n- Strong full-stack defaults (Next.js, TypeScript, ORM, auth, optional tRPC).\n- Great DX, but adds extra layers and conventions that may be overkill for MVP.\n\n### Selected Starter: create-next-app\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nThe MVP is low-complexity and self-hosted. The official Next.js starter provides the cleanest foundation while letting us add only the pieces we need (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres, Auth) without adopting heavier conventions.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest travelblogs\n```\n\nChoose during prompts: TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and `src/` directory.\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nTypeScript + React with Next.js.\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nTailwind CSS (via CLI prompt).\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nNext.js dev server with fast refresh; Turbopack enabled by default.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nNot included by default (will add if needed).\n\n**Code Organization:**\nApp Router structure (`app/`), optional `src/` directory.\n\n**Development Experience:**\nBuilt-in dev server, linting (ESLint), and standard Next.js conventions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Database: SQLite\n- ORM: Prisma (7.2.0) + Prisma Migrate\n- Authentication: Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 with JWT sessions\n- API style: REST via Next.js route handlers\n- Hosting: bare Node process on NAS\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Validation: Zod 4.2.1\n- Authorization: role checks + per-trip ACL\n- Error format: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- State management: Redux (Redux Toolkit 2.11.2)\n- Data fetching: server components + `fetch`\n- Media optimization: Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- Env configuration: `.env` files\n- Logging: basic file logs\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Docker deployment\n- Reverse proxy/TLS (Caddy/Nginx)\n- Rate limiting\n- PostgreSQL migration (if scale requires)\n- Map/timeline provider selection and licensing (required before Phase 3)\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)\n- **ORM:** Prisma 7.2.0\n- **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate\n- **Validation:** Zod 4.2.1\n- **Rationale:** SQLite keeps MVP simple for NAS hosting; Prisma provides schema + migrations; Zod standardizes request and data validation.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13\n- **Sessions:** JWT\n- **Authorization:** role-based checks + per-trip ACL\n- **MVP Auth Scope:** Lightweight creator sign-in (single account) to protect trip/entry management; shareable links remain public.\n- **Rationale:** Free, self-hosted auth with minimal custom work; JWT reduces DB session overhead for MVP.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST via Next.js route handlers\n- **Error format:** `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- **Rate limiting:** None (MVP)\n- **Rationale:** Simple, direct fit for low-complexity MVP and App Router.\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- **State management:** Redux via Redux Toolkit 2.11.2\n- **Data fetching:** Server components + `fetch`\n- **Media optimization:** Next.js Image + lazy loading\n- **Component library:** Tailwind UI (themeable baseline aligned with Tailwind CSS)\n- **Typography:** Fraunces (headings) + Source Serif 4 (body) delivered via `next/font`\n- **Rationale:** Centralized state for UI/entry flows; server-driven data for performance; optimized media is core to UX.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hosting:** Bare Node process on NAS\n- **Reverse proxy/TLS:** None (MVP)\n- **Env config:** `.env` files\n- **Monitoring/logging:** Basic file logs\n- **Rationale:** Lowest friction for MVP; can add Docker + TLS later.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Initialize Next.js app (starter)\n2. Add Prisma + SQLite schema + migrations\n3. Implement lightweight Auth.js + JWT sessions for creator sign-in\n4. Build REST route handlers + error format\n5. Add Redux store and UI data flows\n6. Implement media upload + Next.js Image rendering\n7. Configure `.env` and basic logging\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Auth + ACL affects API handlers and UI gating.\n- Prisma schema drives API, validation, and UI data models.\n- Media optimization affects storage strategy and frontend rendering.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\n5 areas where AI agents could make different choices (naming, structure, formats, state conventions, error/loading patterns)\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables: singular (`user`, `trip`, `entry`)\n- Columns: `camelCase` (`userId`, `tripId`)\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints: plural (`/trips`, `/entries`)\n- Route params: `:id`\n- Query params: `camelCase`\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Components: `PascalCase` (`TripCard`)\n- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`trip-card.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: `camelCase`\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Tests live in a central `tests/` folder\n- Components organized by feature (`components/trips/...`)\n- Shared utilities in `utils/`\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- API routes only in `app/api/...` (no separate `src/server` layer)\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Wrap responses in `{ data, error }`\n- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- Dates: ISO 8601 strings\n- JSON fields: `camelCase`\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**State Management Patterns (Redux):**\n- Action naming: `feature/action`\n- State shape: `state.{feature}`\n- Async: Redux Toolkit patterns (no RTK Query)\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Global error boundary + per-request error UI\n\n**Loading State Patterns:**\n- Use `status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'`\n\n**Validation Patterns:**\n- Server-side only\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow singular table naming + camelCase columns\n- Return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`\n- Use feature-based component folders and central `tests/`\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- New code should be reviewed for naming/format consistency before merge\n- Violations should be noted in PR review and fixed before merge\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Table: `trip`, column: `tripId`\n- Endpoint: `GET /trips/:id`\n- Response: `{ data: { ... }, error: null }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Table `Trips` or column `trip_id`\n- Endpoint `/trip/{id}`\n- Response without wrapper or inconsistent error shape\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\ntravelblogs/\n├── README.md\n├──

under `src/app/api/*`\n- Auth endpoints in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n- UI components grouped by feature under `src/components/<feature>/`\n- Shared UI atoms in `src/components/ui/`\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n- Data access through Prisma in `prisma/` and helpers in `src/utils/`\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n- Database schema and migrations in `prisma/`\n- Domain types in `src/types/domain.ts`\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**Feature Mapping:**\n- Trips: `src/app/trips/`, `src/components/trips/`, `src/app/api/trips/`, `tests/api/`, `tests/components/`\n- Entries: `src/app/entries/`, `src/components/entries/`, `src/app/api/entries/`, `tests/api/`, `tests/components/`\n- Media: `src/components/media/`, `src/app/api/media/`, `tests/api/`\n- Sharing: `src/app/api/trips/` + `src/components/trips/` for share views\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n- Auth: `src/app/api/auth/`, `src/components/auth/`,

The experience prioritizes private, intentional sharing over public social feeds, with media-first daily entries that are easy to consume on a single page.\n\n### Target Users\n\n- Primary: solo travelers and couples who want structured, web-based trip journals and a clean way to share them with trusted people.\n- Secondary: friends/family who follow along as viewers; trusted companions who can contribute entries when invited.\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n- Reduce friction for daily entry creation while supporting rich media.\n- Keep trip context visible (map + timeline) without overwhelming first-time users.\n- Balance private sharing with lightweight collaboration and clear roles.\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n- A distinctive map + timeline “story mode” that makes trips feel like chapters.\n- Media-first capture with auto-save and later editing to fit travel-day realities.\n- A one-page viewer experience optimized for fast, immersive consumption.\n\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\nThe core loop is simple: users open the app to see new trip entries, select a trip, and read the latest blog entry. The product succeeds when this exploration feels fast, natural, and frictionless.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nTravelBlogs is a web-first application that must work smoothly on mobile browsers. Interaction should feel natural with mouse or touch, with minimal reliance on keyboard input. Offline support and device-specific capabilities are not required.\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Exploring trips and switching between them should feel immediate.\n- Opening a blog entry and reading it should be simple and uninterrupted.\n- Navigation should feel natural and predictable across desktop and mobile.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- The user feels “this is better” when navigation is simple and easy while exploring trips.\n- The experience fails if navigation feels complicated or confusing, causing users to abandon the app.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- Make trip exploration and entry reading effortless.\n- Prioritize natural, obvious navigation over feature density.\n- Keep interactions fast and low-friction across devices.\n- Reduce cognitive load during the read experience.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n- Feel the joy of traveling while reading.\n- Experience the trip as if they are there.\n- Feel inspired to plan their own trip.\n- Feel confident and capable regardless of tech skill.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- First discovery: intrigued and excited by the promise of “being there.”\n- Core experience: immersed, joyful, and curious while exploring entries.\n- After reading: inspired and motivated to travel or share the story.\n- If something goes wrong: feel supported and not overwhelmed.\n- Returning: feel welcomed and confident that it will be simple again.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- Confidence over confusion.\n- Trust over skepticism.\n- Excitement over anxiety.\n- Accomplishment over frustration.\n- Delight over plain satisfaction.\n- Connection over isolation.\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Use clear, low-friction navigation to preserve immersion.\n- Keep interface simple and legible for non-technical users.\n- Emphasize media-first storytelling to create “I’m there” feelings.\n- Make recovery gentle when things go wrong to avoid frustration.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- Evoke travel joy through immersive media and storytelling.\n- Design for universal simplicity—no learning curve.\n- Preserve a sense of presence and calm while browsing.\n- Inspire action: “I want to go there too.”\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- Polarsteps: Strong at making trips feel impressive and story-like, with media that is easy to browse. Weakness: account-first onboarding creates friction.\n- FindPenguins: Similar strengths in trip presentation and photo-first browsing. Weaknesses: account-first access and mobile-only experience limit sharing and reach.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- Media-first entry layouts that surface photos immediately to create “I’m there” immersion.\n- Trip storytelling flow that makes browsing entries feel like a journey, not a feed.\n- Simple, visually rich entry cards that invite exploration without cognitive load.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Forcing account creation before viewing a shared trip (hurts sharing and viewership).\n- Mobile-only access that blocks casual viewers who prefer web browsing or no-install access.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n- Media-first storytelling layouts that make trips feel vivid and impressive.\n- Simple, scannable entry browsing that highlights photos first.\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n- Trip narrative flow from mobile apps, optimized for web and larger screens.\n- Sharing flows that allow viewing without sign-in for invited guests.\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Account-first onboarding for viewers.\n- Mobile-only delivery that reduces accessibility and casual engagement.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\nThemeable design system as the foundation (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) to balance speed and customization.\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- Solo developer with limited time needs fast, proven components.\n- Web-first and responsive requirements fit well with established, themeable systems.\n- Allows a distinct visual identity without building everything from scratch.\n- Aligns well with Next.js implementation.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Start with a themeable component library to speed up layout and interaction building.\n- Layer brand tokens (color, typography, spacing) to make the UI feel unique.\n- Use library defaults for accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Customize top-level components: navigation, cards, entry layout, gallery.\n- Keep base controls (buttons, inputs) close to the library defaults.\n- Add a small set of custom components for the map/timeline storytelling feel.\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nOpen the app and immediately see the active trip and the newest blog entries, then flow naturally into reading — with an effortless path to scroll back to the beginning of the trip.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nUsers currently follow trips through a personal blog (e.g., Blogspot), but navigation is unclear and stories are hard to find. They expect a simple, obvious way to see the latest entry first and a clear path to earlier entries without digging through confusing menus.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Active trip is visible on launch.\n- Newest entry is immediately accessible and readable.\n- Users can smoothly scroll back to the start of the trip.\n- Navigation feels clear and organized, not hidden or confusing.\n- Experience feels fluid, even if not ultra-fast.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nUse familiar patterns (trip card + latest entry preview + chronological timeline) to reduce learning curve. The unique twist is a map + timeline storytelling context that still keeps navigation obvious.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation:**  \nUser opens the app and sees the active trip card plus a “Latest Entry” preview.\n\n**2. Interaction:**  \nTap latest entry to read. Scroll to move backward through entries. Menu offers clearly labeled sections (All Trips, Timeline, Map, About).\n\n**3. Feedback:**  \nEntry title/date/location and media confirm they’re in the right place. The timeline position shows where they are in the trip.\n\n**4. Completion:**  \nUser finishes the latest entry, can continue reading earlier entries, or switch trips via the clearly labeled menu.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\nWarm, human, travel-evocative palette with high readability.\n\n- Primary: Warm Terracotta `#D46A4C`\n- Secondary: Deep Teal `#1F6F78`\n- Accent: Sunlit Sand `#F2E2C4`\n- Surface: Warm Ivory `#FBF7F1`\n- Text Primary: Charcoal `#2D2A26`\n- Text Secondary: Warm Gray `#6B635B`\n- Success: Olive Green `#4F7A4A`\n- Warning: Amber `#D9A441`\n- Error: Clay Red `#B34A3C`\n\nSemantic mapping:\n- Primary actions use Terracotta\n- Links/secondary actions use Deep Teal\n- Surfaces use Ivory with Sand highlights\n- Text stays dark for contrast\n\n### Typography System\n\nClean, modern sans-serif typography optimized for long-form entries.\n\n- Headings: `Source Sans 3` (crisp, contemporary)\n- Body: `Source Sans 3` (readable and consistent)\n- Fallbacks: `\"Segoe UI\", \"Calibri\", \"Arial\", sans-serif`\n\nType scale (desktop):\n- H1 36/44, H2 28/36, H3 22/30\n- Body 18/30, Small 15/24\n\nMobile:\n- Reduce by one step; keep body 17/28 for comfort.\n- Line length target: 55-75 characters per line.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- Spacing base: 4px system.\n- Layout: airy with clear section breathing room but not excessive.\n- Max content width: 720-840px for reading comfort.\n- Cards and panels use soft padding (16-24px) with clear separation.\n- Grid: 12-column for desktop, 4-column for mobile; stack on small screens.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Maintain strong contrast for text on ivory backgrounds.\n- Minimum body size 17-18px for readability.\n- Focus states clear and visible for keyboard users.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\nSix directions were explored: Sunlit Journal (story-first), Atlas Path (map + timeline), Postcard Stack (card scan), Gallery Pulse (media grid), Timeline Drift (chronological flow), and Quiet Reader (minimal long-form).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Atlas Path** — a journey-aware layout that blends a map view with a clear timeline of entries.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Matches the core experience: see the active trip and newest entries immediately.\n- Uses familiar navigation patterns with a distinctive map + timeline twist.\n- Keeps orientation obvious for all users, including less tech-savvy readers.\n- Supports the “I’m there” emotional goal with spatial context.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Hero area shows active trip with map and latest entry preview.\n- Timeline list stays prominent for easy back-scrolling.\n- Navigation keeps “All Trips” and “Timeline” as top-level, clearly labeled sections.\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Creator: Create Trip + Post Daily Entry\n\n**Goal:** Create a new trip and publish the first daily entry with media.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B{Signed in?}\n  B -- No --> C[Sign in / create account]\n  B -- Yes --> D[Trips dashboard]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[Create new trip]\n  E --> F[Enter trip details\\n(title, dates, cover)]\n  F --> G[Trip created]\n  G --> H[Add new entry]\n  H --> I[Upload media]\n  I --> J[Write entry text]\n  J --> K[Publish]\n  K --> L[Entry appears at top\\nof timeline]\n  J --> M[Save draft]\n  M --> L\n```\n\n### 2) Viewer: Open Shared Trip + Read Latest Entry\n\n**Goal:** Open a shared link, see active trip, read the latest entry.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open shared link] --> B[Trip landing page]\n  B --> C[Active trip shown\\n+ Latest entry preview]\n  C --> D[Tap latest entry]\n  D --> E[Read entry]\n  E --> F[Scroll timeline\\nfor older entries]\n  B --> G{Account required?}\n  G -- No --> C\n  G -- Yes --> H[Prompt sign-in]\n```\n\n### 3) Contributor: Add Entry to Existing Trip\n\n**Goal:** Add a new entry to a trip where contributor access is enabled.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Open app] --> B[Select shared trip]\n  B --> C{Contributor access?}\n  C -- No --> D[Read-only timeline]\n  C -- Yes --> E[Add entry]\n  E --> F[Upload media]\n  F --> G[Write entry text]\n  G --> H[Publish]\n  H --> I[Entry appears in timeline]\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Navigation pattern:** Active trip card + latest entry preview as primary entry point.\n- **Decision pattern:** Simple permission gating (viewer vs contributor).\n- **Feedback pattern:** New entries appear at top of timeline with clear date/location labels.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Latest entry is always visible on entry.\n- Minimize steps for viewers (no account required).\n- Keep entry creation simple: media → text → publish.\n- Timeline remains the primary way to move backward through the trip.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nLeverage a themeable system (e.g., MUI or Tailwind UI) for core building blocks:\n\n- Buttons, inputs, selects, toggles, chips, badges\n- Cards, lists, tabs, breadcrumbs\n- Modals, drawers, tooltips\n- Grid, typography scale, icons, avatars\n\n### Custom Components\n\n### Active Trip Hero\n\n**Purpose:** Show the active trip and newest entry immediately on open.  \n**Usage:** Home/landing; top of trip view.  \n**Anatomy:** Trip title, dates, map snapshot, latest entry preview CTA.  \n**States:** Default, loading, empty (no entries).  \n**Variants:** Compact (mobile), full (desktop).  \n**Accessibility:** Map snapshot is decorative;

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a creator,\nI want to enable a viewer to contribute to a specific trip,\nso that trusted people can add or edit entries.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am a creator viewing a trip I own  \n   **When** I enable contributor access for a viewer  \n   **Then** that viewer gains contributor permissions for this trip only\n2. **Given** I disable contributor access  \n   **When** the viewer tries to add or edit entries  \n   **Then** they are blocked and can only view the trip\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Add contributor access update API (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Add `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` to toggle `canContribute`\n  - [x] Validate `canContribute` boolean with Zod; return `{ data, error }`\n  - [x] Enforce creator + trip owner authorization\n  - [x] Return 404 for missing invite, 400 for invalid payload\n- [x] Allow contributors to add/edit entries (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Update entry create API to allow `canContribute === true`\n  - [x] Update entry update API to allow `canContribute === true`\n  - [x] Keep delete restricted to creator/owner\n- [x] Update invite UI to manage contributor access (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] Show contributor status in invited viewer list\n  - [x] Add toggle or action to enable/disable contribution per viewer\n  - [x] Keep styling aligned with share panel patterns\n- [x] Add tests (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [x] API tests for contributor toggle + access gating\n  - [x] API tests for contributor create/edit entries\n  - [x] Component tests for contributor toggle UI and error states\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Trip access already exists via `TripAccess` with `canContribute` in Prisma; add a toggle endpoint and surface it in UI. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Current viewer invites/list live under `/api/trips/:id/viewers` with creator-only ownership checks; extend with `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts]\n- Entry create/edit are currently owner-only; allow contributors with `canContribute === true` for the trip while keeping delete creator-only. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts]\n- Access helper `hasTripAccess` only checks membership; add/adjust helper for `canContribute` to avoid duplicating logic. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Invite UI is in the share panel of trip detail; add per-viewer contributor toggle with existing styling. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Follow response format `{ data, error }` and `{ error: { code, message } }` and App Router-only API routes. [Source: _bmad-output/project-context.md]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add a contributor toggle API: `PATCH /api/trips/:id/viewers/:userId` accepting `{ canContribute: boolean }`.\n- Only the trip owner (creator) can toggle contributor access; use the same auth/ownership checks as invite endpoints.\n- 404 for missing trip or invite, 400 for invalid payload, 401/403 for auth failures.\n- Update entry create and entry update to allow contributors with `canContribute === true` on the trip; keep delete creator-only.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO date strings.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes must live under `travelblogs/src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite via existing `prisma` client.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n- Follow naming conventions: camelCase JSON, plural REST paths, singular table names.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for validation.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts` (PATCH).\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts` and `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`.\n- UI updates: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Shared access helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/` and `travelblogs/tests/api/entries/` plus `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests for contributor toggle success, unauthorized access, and missing invite.\n- API tests that contributors can create and edit entries, but cannot delete.\n- Component tests for contributor toggle UI state, error display, and optimistic updates.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.4 added `TripAccess` with `canContribute` default false plus invite list/remove APIs and share panel UI. Reuse the same access checks and response formatting. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Eligible invitee logic and viewer list live in `trip-detail.tsx`; extend the invited list UI rather than creating a new panel. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent work added user management, viewer invites, and trip access checks; avoid regressions in Auth.js session usage and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; extend with a contributor check to minimize repeated queries. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only, REST endpoints plural, and API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: review\n- Completion note: Contributor access toggles, contributor entry permissions, and share panel controls implemented and tested.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip access schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n- Trip viewer APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts`\n- Trip viewer removal API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts`\n- Eligible viewers API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/eligible/route.ts`\n- Entry APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts`\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted contributor toggle API, contributor entry permissions, UI updates, and test coverage expectations.\n- Shipped contributor toggle API with Zod validation plus viewer tests for success/invalid/missing invite cases.\n- Allowed contributors to create/update entries via shared access helper and covered contributor create/edit/delete gating in entry tests.\n- Added contributor status badges and toggle controls to the share panel with optimistic updates and error handling tests.\n- Completed contributor API and UI test coverage for toggle, create/edit gating, and share panel behaviors.\n- Hardened contributor access checks for inactive users and added defensive UI toggle guards.\n- Added trip-only scope copy for contributor access plus tests for inactive contributor blocks.\n\n### File List\n\n- .codex/history.jsonl\n- .codex/log/codex-tui.log\n- .codex/version.json\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/[userId]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/viewers/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/viewers.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/create-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/update-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/entries/delete-entry.test.ts\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trip-share-panel.test.tsx\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2025-12-31: Added contributor toggle API, contributor entry permissions, share panel controls, and test coverage.\n- 2025-12-31: Guarded contributor toggles, enforced active-user checks, and expanded inactive contributor tests.\n- 2025-12-31: Synced sprint-status tracking for story review updates.\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts]\n- `TripAccess` is the single source of truth for invited trips and already enforces active users via access checks. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts] [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n- Trips UI currently assumes creator ownership and always shows create/manage actions; gate by `session.user.role`. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n- Access denial for uninvited trips is already enforced by `hasTripAccess` in trip and entry APIs; keep that behavior intact. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/entries/route.ts]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Update `GET /api/trips` to return the same list fields for viewers:\n  - `id`, `title`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `coverImageUrl`, `updatedAt`\n- Viewer query should pull trips from `TripAccess` for the requesting user, ordered by `trip.updatedAt DESC`.\n- Preserve response envelope `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` for failures.\n- Reject unauthorized roles or missing role in the token with `403 FORBIDDEN` (do not assume creator).\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Keep the trips list layout aligned with the existing warm palette and typography system; do not introduce new layout patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- For viewers, use a read-only trips list with a clear header and empty state copy (no create/manage actions). [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router route handlers only; keep API under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models and avoid schema changes for this story.\n- Enforce role-based access checks on the server, even if UI hides creator actions.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub` and `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n- Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- API update: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`.\n- Trips page UI updates: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts` and relevant component tests under `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Viewer sees only invited trips (no creator-owned trips unless invited).\n  - Viewer with no invites receives an empty list (200).\n  - Missing/unknown role returns 403; unauthenticated returns 401.\n- Component tests:\n  - Viewer sees invited trips list and no creator actions.\n  - Viewer empty state copy renders when no invited trips.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Trip invites and `TripAccess` records were introduced in Story 5.4; reuse those patterns and avoid new access tables. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-4-invite-viewers-to-a-trip.md]\n- Story 5.5 added contributor toggles and extended access helpers; keep access checks centralized to prevent duplication. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added user management, viewer invites, and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n- Trip access helper is currently membership-only; use it for access checks, but list queries should pull from `TripAccess` directly for performance. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: done\n- Completion note: Viewer trip access is implemented, reviewed, and verified with targeted tests.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip list API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts`\n- Trips page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Gate trip list API by `token.role` and return viewer lists via `TripAccess`.\n- Update trips page header/actions/empty states by session role.\n- Add API + component tests for viewer list and empty state coverage.\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Implemented viewer-aware list handling in `GET /api/trips`, preserving creator ownership behavior and role-based errors.\n- Updated trips page copy/actions for viewer read-only list/empty states.\n- Added API and component tests; ran `npm test`.\n- Tightened creator role checks for trip mutations and blocked inactive accounts in trip listing.\n- Added viewer inactive list guard and unknown-role UI fallback coverage.\n- Noted tooling artifacts in git status (`.codex/*`, validation report) as non-story outputs.\n- Expanded creator trip list to include trips they are invited to (deduped, ordered by updatedAt).\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/route.ts\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/list-trips.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/create-trip.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/update-trip.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/delete-trip.test.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trips-page.test.tsx\n\n## Change Log\n\n- 2026-01-03: Enabled viewer trip list access + viewer trips UI gating; added tests.\n- 2026-01-03: Fixed creator role checks for trip mutations, added inactive-user trip list guard, and updated tests/UI fallback.\n- 2026-01-03: Included invited trips in creator list responses.\n"}}

problems, pain points, and success metrics to ensure we’re solving the right travel-blogger needs.\n+- **SCAMPER Method (structured):** Systematically riffs on features/UX (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) for trips, entries, media, and sharing.\n+- **Analogical Thinking (creative):** Borrows proven patterns from adjacent domains (journaling apps, photo galleries, social feeds) to differentiate the travel blogging experience.\n+\n+**AI Rationale:** Start by clarifying the problem space and success signals (Question Storming), then generate structured feature variations (SCAMPER), and finish by importing winning patterns from related products (Analogical Thinking) to create a differentiated experience.\n*** End

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-03T12:40:56.661Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<environment_context>\\n  <cwd>/Users/tommy/Development/TravelBlogs</cwd>\\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\\n</environment_context>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-03T12:41:06.031Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"\\nYou must fully embody this agent's persona and follow all activation instructions exactly as specified.

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user,\nI want a user manual that explains navigation and actions by role and trip permissions,\nso that I can understand how to use the app based on my access.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as any role\n   **When** I open the user manual\n   **Then** I see sections tailored to my role (creator, viewer)\n2. **Given** I view the manual as a viewer without contributor access\n   **When** I read the permissions section\n   **Then** I see only read-only actions and navigation options\n3. **Given** I view the manual as a contributor\n   **When** I read the permissions section\n   **Then** I see entry create/edit actions and their navigation paths\n4. **Given** I view the manual as a creator\n   **When** I read the manual\n   **Then** I see admin, trip management, sharing, and contributor controls\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Define manual content structure (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Outline role-based sections (viewer, contributor, creator)\n  - [ ] List permitted actions per role and navigation paths\n- [ ] Add manual UI page (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Create `/manual` page with role-aware sections\n  - [ ] Use warm palette + typography tokens and readable layout\n- [ ] Wire access context (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Use session role to show appropriate sections\n  - [ ] Use trip access info to show contributor vs viewer content\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Component tests for role-specific content rendering\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- The app already has role-based access control in Auth.js sessions; use `session.user.role` as the primary role indicator. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts]\n- Trip permissions (viewer vs contributor) are modeled via `TripAccess.canContribute`; use existing access helper or props to determine contributor content. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts]\n- Follow existing page layout style for centered panels and warm palette. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- The manual page must be accessible to authenticated users and reflect their role and trip permissions.\n- The manual must clearly document navigation and actions for each role without exposing actions the user cannot perform.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` where API data is used.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Use the established typography system and warm palette; keep line lengths readable (55-75 chars). [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- Manual content should be scannable with headings, short paragraphs, and action lists.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; page under `src/app`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation only if needed (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Manual UI: `travelblogs/src/app/manual/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - Viewer role sees viewer-only actions.\n  - Contributor sees contributor actions.\n  - Creator sees admin/trip management actions.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Epic 5 stories established role-based access and contributor permissions; reuse those rules for manual content. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-5-enable-contributor-access-for-a-viewer.md]\n- Viewer access rules are defined in Story 5.6; do not advertise contributor actions to view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Auth options: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`\n- Trip access helper: `travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted role-based manual content requirements and UI page scope.\n- Added test coverage expectations for role-specific manual content.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts\n- travelblogs/src/utils/trip-access.ts\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app]\n- Date formatting is done with `toLocaleDateString` in several components; standardize locale usage based on the selected language. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx]\n- Keep locale formatting consistent with EN (`en-US`) and DE (`de-DE`).\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Supported locales: English and German only.\n- Language selection must update all visible UI strings without full page reload if feasible.\n- Date/time formatting must follow the selected locale (e.g., `en-US` vs `de-DE`).\n- Persist preference across sessions.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Selector should be clear and unobtrusive; match existing button/typography styling. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n- Use short labels (e.g., EN / DE or English / Deutsch) and clear state indication.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; no external i18n framework unless approved.\n- Use TypeScript and central utilities for translation and formatting.\n- Avoid adding new top-level directories; use `utils/` for shared helpers.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite (no schema changes required unless storing preference in DB).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Translation utilities: `travelblogs/src/utils/`.\n- Selector UI placement: existing global layout or trip header as decided.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/` and `travelblogs/tests/utils/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - Language selector toggles UI text between EN and DE.\n  - Language preference persists after reload.\n- Utility tests:\n  - Date formatting outputs expected locale formats for EN/DE.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Role-based access and trip views already exist; do not break share-link views when switching language. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-5-invalidate-shared-entry-pages-on-revoke.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and contributor access; avoid regressions in Auth.js session handling and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted language selection requirements with EN/DE localization and locale date/time formatting.\n- Added persistence and test coverage expectations.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/components/entries/entry-detail.tsx\n"}}
