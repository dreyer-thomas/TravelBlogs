Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts]\n- User role enum lives in Prisma schema; adding Administrator requires migration and updated type usage across auth/session code. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma] [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- Manage Users UI uses `UserList` for role changes; extend the selector and error handling there. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx]\n- Safeguards should be enforced server-side first (API), with UI reflecting errors returned in `{ data, error }` format.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add `administrator` to `UserRole` enum and update any role comparisons to include it for admin-only access.\n- Admin-only API routes must accept `creator` and `administrator`, while keeping the hard-coded `creator` account protections.\n- Block role changes that would leave zero active admins (`creator` + `administrator` with `isActive === true`).\n- Block self-demotion for `administrator` users.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`; all timestamps ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Role selector lists `creator`, `administrator`, `viewer` with clear labels.\n- Safeguard violations show inline errors without losing form state.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; migrations required for enum change.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- Auth helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`, `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- User APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/status/route.ts`.\n- Admin UI: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/users-dashboard.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/users/`, `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Admin can assign Administrator role.\n  - Administrator can access admin-only endpoints.\n  - Self-demotion blocked with `403 FORBIDDEN`.\n  - Last active admin cannot be deleted or deactivated.\n- Component tests:\n  - Administrator option visible in role selector.\n  - Guardrail errors rendered inline without losing selection state.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.1 established user management and admin gate; reuse existing response formats and validation patterns.

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts]\n- User role enum lives in Prisma schema; adding Administrator requires migration and updated type usage across auth/session code. [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma] [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- Manage Users UI uses `UserList` for role changes; extend the selector and error handling there. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx]\n- Safeguards should be enforced server-side first (API), with UI reflecting errors returned in `{ data, error }` format.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add `administrator` to `UserRole` enum and update any role comparisons to include it for admin-only access.\n- Admin-only API routes must accept `creator` and `administrator`, while keeping the hard-coded `creator` account protections.\n- Block role changes that would leave zero active admins (`creator` + `administrator` with `isActive === true`).\n- Block self-demotion for `administrator` users.\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`; all timestamps ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Role selector lists `creator`, `administrator`, `viewer` with clear labels.\n- Safeguard violations show inline errors without losing form state.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; migrations required for enum change.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`.\n- Auth helpers: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`, `travelblogs/src/utils/auth-options.ts`, `travelblogs/src/types/next-auth.d.ts`.\n- User APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/status/route.ts`.\n- Admin UI: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/components/admin/users-dashboard.tsx`, `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/users/`, `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Admin can assign Administrator role.\n  - Administrator can access admin-only endpoints.\n  - Self-demotion blocked with `403 FORBIDDEN`.\n  - Last active admin cannot be deleted or deactivated.\n- Component tests:\n  - Administrator option visible in role selector.\n  - Guardrail errors rendered inline without losing selection state.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.1 established user management and admin gate; reuse existing response formats and validation patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-1-admin-creates-user-accounts.md]\n- Story 5.8 adds deactivate/delete flows; ensure safeguards extend to those actions. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-8-admin-deactivates-user.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits focused on user management and auth flows; avoid regressions in admin-only checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n"}}
