Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs an admin,\nI want to deactivate or delete a user account,\nso that removed users can no longer access the system and I can permanently remove users when needed.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in as an admin  \n   **When** I deactivate a user  \n   **Then** the user is marked inactive and cannot sign in\n2. **Given** a deactivated user attempts to sign in  \n   **When** they submit valid credentials  \n   **Then** access is denied with a clear error\n3. **Given** I am signed in as an admin  \n   **When** I delete a user  \n   **Then** the user account is removed from the system  \n   **And** the user no longer appears in the user list\n4. **Given** I delete a user  \n   **When** they attempt to sign in  \n   **Then** access is denied with a clear error\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add admin API for user activation status (AC: 1, 2)\n  - [ ] Create `PATCH /api/users/[id]/status` to set `isActive` true/false\n  - [ ] Reuse admin auth gate and JSON error format\n  - [ ] Block updates for `creator` admin account\n- [ ] Add admin API for deleting users (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [ ] Implement `DELETE /api/users/[id]` in the existing user route\n  - [ ] Block deletion for `creator` admin account\n  - [ ] Block deletion when user owns trips (require reassignment first)\n- [ ] Update admin UI to manage status and deletion (AC: 1, 3)\n  - [ ] Add Activate/Deactivate control in `UserList` edit panel\n  - [ ] Add Delete action with confirmation and safe error handling\n  - [ ] Disable destructive actions for the current admin user\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] API tests for status toggle (admin only, invalid payload, not found)\n  - [ ] API tests for delete (admin only, blocked for creator, blocked for owner)\n  - [ ] Component tests for status toggle and delete confirmation handling\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- Admin auth is enforced by checking `token.sub === \"creator\"`; reuse the existing admin guard logic for new routes. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts]\n- Inactive users are already blocked from signing in via credential validation; keep this behavior unchanged. [Source: travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts]\n- The Manage Users UI lives in the admin dashboard and `UserList` component; add actions there rather than creating a new page. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx] [Source: travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx]\n- User deletion should not orphan trips; guard against deleting users who own trips (Trip.ownerId). [Source: travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Deactivation sets `User.isActive` to `false` and reactivation sets it to `true`.\n- `PATCH /api/users/[id]/status` must return `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` on failures.\n- `DELETE /api/users/[id]` must remove the user record and cascade `TripAccess` rows.\n- Reject delete/deactivate requests for the `creator` admin account with `403 FORBIDDEN`.\n- Reject delete if the user owns any trips; return a clear `409` or `403` error with guidance.\n- All timestamps in responses must remain ISO strings.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Deactivate/Activate controls should sit alongside role editing in the existing edit panel styling. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx]\n- Delete must require explicit confirmation and surface errors inline without losing list state.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- User list UI: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`.\n- Admin users page: `travelblogs/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`.\n- User API routes: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/status/route.ts`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/api/users/` and `travelblogs/tests/components/admin/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- API tests:\n  - Admin can deactivate and reactivate a user.\n  - Deactivated user cannot authenticate (mocked credentials flow).\n  - Admin can delete a user who owns no trips.\n  - Deleting a trip owner is blocked with clear error.\n  - Non-admin users receive `403 FORBIDDEN` on status/delete.\n- Component tests:\n  - Status toggle updates badge and handles API errors.\n  - Delete action prompts confirmation and handles API error state.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 5.1 introduced the user management endpoints and admin gate; reuse the same auth checks and response shapes. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-1-admin-creates-user-accounts.md]\n- Story 5.11 added user password change flows; keep admin actions separate from password management. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-11-change-password.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits touched user management and auth flows; avoid regressions in admin-only checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- User list UI: `travelblogs/src/components/admin/user-list.tsx`\n- User APIs: `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/route.ts`, `travelblogs/src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`\n- Auth validation: `travelblogs/src/utils/auth.ts`\n- Prisma schema: `travelblogs/prisma/schema.prisma`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted admin deactivation/delete story with API, UI, and testing guardrails.\n- Mapped user management routes and admin dashboard components for targeted edits.\n- Documented constraints for creator admin and trip owner deletion safety.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-8-admin-deactivates-user.md\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}
