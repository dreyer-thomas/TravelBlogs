[Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx]\n- Trip dates are displayed using `toLocaleDateString` with `timeZone: \"UTC\"`; align active range checks with the same UTC basis. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx]\n- Trips list is rendered on the Manage Trips page; no API changes required. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Date comparison must be done in UTC to match existing display logic.\n- A trip is active if the current date is on or after `startDate` and on or before `endDate`.\n- No API changes required; keep existing trip list response shape.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- The \"Active\" badge styling must remain unchanged when shown.\n- Do not show any placeholder when inactive; simply omit the badge.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; no new API routes required.\n- Use existing component structure and utility patterns.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Use standard Date APIs (no new date libraries unless approved).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Component update: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - Past trip: no badge.\n  - Future trip: no badge.\n  - Current trip (inclusive): badge visible.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Trip list UI already uses the warm palette and typography tokens; preserve existing visuals. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer access and trip list changes; avoid regressions in trips page rendering.

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx]\n- Trip dates are displayed using `toLocaleDateString` with `timeZone: \"UTC\"`; align active range checks with the same UTC basis. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx]\n- Trips list is rendered on the Manage Trips page; no API changes required. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- Date comparison must be done in UTC to match existing display logic.\n- A trip is active if the current date is on or after `startDate` and on or before `endDate`.\n- No API changes required; keep existing trip list response shape.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- The \"Active\" badge styling must remain unchanged when shown.\n- Do not show any placeholder when inactive; simply omit the badge.\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; no new API routes required.\n- Use existing component structure and utility patterns.\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Use standard Date APIs (no new date libraries unless approved).\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Component update: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - Past trip: no badge.\n  - Future trip: no badge.\n  - Current trip (inclusive): badge visible.\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Trip list UI already uses the warm palette and typography tokens; preserve existing visuals. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer access and trip list changes; avoid regressions in trips page rendering. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- Trip card component: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx`\n- Trips page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted date-range active badge behavior aligned to UTC date display.\n- Added test coverage expectations for past/current/future trips.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-card.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/page.tsx\n"}}
