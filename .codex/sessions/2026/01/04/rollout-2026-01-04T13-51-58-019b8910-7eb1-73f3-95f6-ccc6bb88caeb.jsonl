Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user (creator, contributor, or viewer),\nI want to open the shared viewer experience for a trip,\nso that I can read the trip story in the best viewing mode.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in and have access to a trip\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I see a \"View\" button that opens the shared-view reader for that trip\n2. **Given** I am a contributor or the trip owner\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I also see an \"Edit\" button for the trip\n3. **Given** I am a viewer without contributor access\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I do not see the \"Edit\" button\n4. **Given** the shared-view link does not yet exist\n   **When** I select \"View\"\n   **Then** the system creates (or retrieves) the share link and opens the shared-view reader\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add shared-view entry point on trip detail (AC: 1, 4)\n  - [ ] Reuse existing share-link API to fetch/create the shared view URL\n  - [ ] Add a \"View\" button next to trip actions and open `/trips/share/[token]`\n- [ ] Gate edit affordance by role/access (AC: 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Show \"Edit\" only when `canEditTrip === true`\n  - [ ] Keep viewers read-only (no edit affordance)\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Component test for \"View\" button visibility and click behavior\n  - [ ] Component test for \"Edit\" button visibility based on role\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- The shared-view experience already exists at `/trips/share/[token]`; use the share-link API to get or create the token. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx]\n- Trip detail already manages share-link state; integrate the \"View\" button with that state instead of adding new endpoints. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access flags are passed from the trip detail page (`canEditTrip`, etc.); use those for gating buttons. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- The \"View\" button must open the shared-view URL (`/trips/share/[token]`) for the current trip.\n- If the share link is missing, the button should create or fetch one via existing share-link API and then open it.\n- The \"Edit\" button must link to the current trip edit experience (`/trips/[tripId]/edit`).\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Buttons should match the existing trip action styling and hierarchy (warm palette, rounded buttons). [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- View should be the primary action for viewers; edit should remain secondary and hidden for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`.\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - View button visible for all authorized roles with trip access.\n  - Edit button visible only for contributors/owners.\n  - Clicking view opens `/trips/share/[token]` (using mocked share-link API).\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.1/4.5 established share-link behavior and invalidation; reuse those endpoints and patterns.

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- Next.js (create-next-app latest) + App Router\n- React (via Next.js)\n- TypeScript (via Next.js)\n- Tailwind CSS (via Next.js setup)\n- Prisma 7.2.0 (ORM + migrations)\n- SQLite (primary DB)\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 (JWT sessions)\n- Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 (state)\n- Zod 4.2.1 (validation)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions; avoid `snake_case`.\n- Keep DB table names singular and Prisma model names singular.\n- Use async/await for async flows; no raw Promise chains.\n- API errors must use `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Dates in JSON must be ISO 8601 strings.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n- App Router only; all API routes live under `src/app/api`.\n- REST endpoints are plural (`/trips`, `/entries`), params use `:id`.\n- Responses must be wrapped `{ data, error }`.\n- Components are `PascalCase`, files are `kebab-case.tsx`.\n- Feature components live in `src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Redux state slices live in `src/store/<feature>/` with actions `feature/action`.\n- Use Next.js Image for media; lazy-load by default.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Tests live in central `tests/` (no co-located tests).\n- Organize tests by `tests/api`, `tests/components`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`.\n- Use the API error format in test expectations.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` vars, `PascalCase` components, `kebab-case.tsx` files.\n- API response shape must be `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Use `utils/` for shared helpers; avoid adding `lib/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Use `.env` and `.env.example`; no `.env.local`.\n- Keep REST routes in `src/app/api` only.\n- Docker and TLS proxy are post-MVP; do not add in MVP work.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- Do not use `snake_case` in JSON or API params.\n- Do not create singular REST endpoints (no `/trip`).\n- Do not bypass `{ data, error }` response wrapper.\n- Do not colocate tests with source files.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2025-12-21T17:43:06Z\n"}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a user (creator, contributor, or viewer),\nI want to open the shared viewer experience for a trip,\nso that I can read the trip story in the best viewing mode.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** I am signed in and have access to a trip\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I see a \"View\" button that opens the shared-view reader for that trip\n2. **Given** I am a contributor or the trip owner\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I also see an \"Edit\" button for the trip\n3. **Given** I am a viewer without contributor access\n   **When** I open the trip detail view\n   **Then** I do not see the \"Edit\" button\n4. **Given** the shared-view link does not yet exist\n   **When** I select \"View\"\n   **Then** the system creates (or retrieves) the share link and opens the shared-view reader\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Add shared-view entry point on trip detail (AC: 1, 4)\n  - [ ] Reuse existing share-link API to fetch/create the shared view URL\n  - [ ] Add a \"View\" button next to trip actions and open `/trips/share/[token]`\n- [ ] Gate edit affordance by role/access (AC: 2, 3)\n  - [ ] Show \"Edit\" only when `canEditTrip === true`\n  - [ ] Keep viewers read-only (no edit affordance)\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests (AC: 1-4)\n  - [ ] Component test for \"View\" button visibility and click behavior\n  - [ ] Component test for \"Edit\" button visibility based on role\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- The shared-view experience already exists at `/trips/share/[token]`; use the share-link API to get or create the token. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx]\n- Trip detail already manages share-link state; integrate the \"View\" button with that state instead of adding new endpoints. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access flags are passed from the trip detail page (`canEditTrip`, etc.); use those for gating buttons. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- The \"View\" button must open the shared-view URL (`/trips/share/[token]`) for the current trip.\n- If the share link is missing, the button should create or fetch one via existing share-link API and then open it.\n- The \"Edit\" button must link to the current trip edit experience (`/trips/[tripId]/edit`).\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Buttons should match the existing trip action styling and hierarchy (warm palette, rounded buttons). [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- View should be the primary action for viewers; edit should remain secondary and hidden for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`.\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - View button visible for all authorized roles with trip access.\n  - Edit button visible only for contributors/owners.\n  - Clicking view opens `/trips/share/[token]` (using mocked share-link API).\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.1/4.5 established share-link behavior and invalidation; reuse those endpoints and patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-5-invalidate-shared-entry-pages-on-revoke.md]\n- Story 5.6 added viewer access gating; maintain read-only affordances for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and trip access gating; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: ready-for-dev\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`\n- Share link API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted shared-view button requirements with role-gated edit affordance.\n- Reused existing share-link API and shared-view route patterns.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/epics.md\n- _bmad-output/architecture.md\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts\n"}}

[Source: travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts] [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx]\n- Trip detail already manages share-link state; integrate the \"View\" button with that state instead of adding new endpoints. [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- Trip access flags are passed from the trip detail page (`canEditTrip`, etc.); use those for gating buttons. [Source: travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx]\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n- The \"View\" button must open the shared-view URL (`/trips/share/[token]`) for the current trip.\n- If the share link is missing, the button should create or fetch one via existing share-link API and then open it.\n- The \"Edit\" button must link to the current trip edit experience (`/trips/[tripId]/edit`).\n- Responses must remain `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }` and ISO timestamps.\n\n### UX Requirements\n\n- Buttons should match the existing trip action styling and hierarchy (warm palette, rounded buttons). [Source: travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx]\n- View should be the primary action for viewers; edit should remain secondary and hidden for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md]\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- App Router only; API routes under `src/app/api`.\n- Use Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite models; no schema changes required.\n- Use Zod 4.2.1 for request validation (server-side only).\n\n### Library/Framework Requirements\n\n- Next.js App Router + TypeScript.\n- Auth.js (NextAuth) 4.24.13 JWT sessions with `token.sub`, `token.role`.\n- Prisma 7.2.0 + SQLite.\n\n### File Structure Requirements\n\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`.\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`.\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`.\n- Tests: `travelblogs/tests/components/`.\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- Component tests:\n  - View button visible for all authorized roles with trip access.\n  - Edit button visible only for contributors/owners.\n  - Clicking view opens `/trips/share/[token]` (using mocked share-link API).\n\n### Previous Story Intelligence\n\n- Story 4.1/4.5 established share-link behavior and invalidation; reuse those endpoints and patterns. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-5-invalidate-shared-entry-pages-on-revoke.md]\n- Story 5.6 added viewer access gating; maintain read-only affordances for view-only users. [Source: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-6-viewer-access-to-invited-trips.md]\n\n### Git Intelligence Summary\n\n- Recent commits added viewer invites and trip access gating; avoid regressions in Auth.js role checks and `{ data, error }` response shape. [Source: git log -5]\n\n### Latest Tech Information\n\n- Web research not performed due to network restrictions; use pinned versions and patterns in `_bmad-output/project-context.md`.\n\n### Project Context Reference\n\n- App Router only; REST endpoints plural; API responses wrapped `{ data, error }` with `{ error: { code, message } }`.\n- Tests live in `tests/` (no co-located tests) and JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Do not introduce Docker/TLS proxy in MVP tasks.\n\n### Story Completion Status\n\n- Status: review\n- Completion note: Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- API routes live under `travelblogs/src/app/api` and must be plural.\n- Components live under `travelblogs/src/components/<feature>/`.\n- Tests live under `travelblogs/tests/` (no co-located tests).\n\n### References\n\n- Epic and acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/epics.md`\n- Architecture and patterns: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`\n- Project rules: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n- UX design system: `_bmad-output/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Trip detail UI: `travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx`\n- Trip detail page: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/[tripId]/page.tsx`\n- Share link API: `travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts`\n- Shared view route: `travelblogs/src/app/trips/share/[token]/page.tsx`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nCodex (GPT-5)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Drafted shared-view button requirements with role-gated edit affordance.\n- Reused existing share-link API and shared-view route patterns.\n- Implemented shared-view action on trip detail with share-link creation and router navigation.\n- Allowed share-link GET/POST for users with trip access while keeping owner-only rotate/revoke.\n- Added component/API coverage for view access and share-link access; ran `npm test` and `npm run lint`.\n\n### File List\n\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5-12-shared-view-button.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- travelblogs/src/components/trips/trip-detail.tsx\n- travelblogs/src/app/api/trips/[id]/share-link/route.ts\n- travelblogs/tests/components/trip-detail.test.tsx\n- travelblogs/tests/api/trips/share-link.test.ts\n"}}
