I think it would be good to enter tags in the story and show them in the trips page as well as in the trip overview of the shared view. Also on each story page this can be shown on the hero image on top right. The idea of tags could be a place, a city or maybe a phase of a trip. So the reader can see which stories belong together or also to see the place the story belongs to, e.g. a city name or an island or so."}

The viewer can use it to see to what this stor belongs to. Also invited users can do that. 2 - I want to see the tags everywhere where the trip is shown. I alos want to filter stories using tags. 3 - tags are part of the story and can be entered in the story edit dialog just beside the media, text and location. 4 - Not many, I assume often only one or not even this one. But sometimes more up to three. 5 - Yes filtering would be good. I like the idea to have a tag filter on top of the list of stories. Depending on the number of different tags this can be a horizontal list of tags and clicking one means filtering. If there are more than this should be changed to a selection box to select one or even more tags. 6 - two main things: Finding a story by filtering and second to have a fast impression what the story is about."}

In the story reader in the hero image on the top right corner of the image right bound. 2 - Free text. But there should be a feature to show already used ones during typing. This helps to use the same tags again wothout typos. 3 - Multi select shall be possible, but in most cases the user will only select one. 4 - Adding or changing tags is for the creator or contributor only. All other users can only see them or use filters. 5 - No translation required. Often these are names of cities or islands or so."}

On the trips list we do not see the tags. 2 - yes, but not hard. It should be possible to have some more, but the UI should be optimized for max 3. 3 - keep the tags as they are, so no change to what the contibutor or creator has typed. 4 - yes, sounds good. 5 - No, OR mode. If the user selects two tags than all stories of tag 1 and tag 2 shall be shown. So if I select London and Paris I want to see all stories tagged with Paris or London."}
